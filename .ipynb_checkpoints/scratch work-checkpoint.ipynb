       "'I\\'ve always liked their 2015 feud better than their 2014 one Are you saying he [never drew a dime?](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-16-2015/QG0F4Y.gif) Reinvented? No. Returned to form? Yes. \\n\\nHe was killing it right before he got signed and was blowing up and then he got signed and they made him look like a geek and once he left he could finally be the Sami Callihan of old.  He has been on a few times. Which means a lot of wrestlemania paydays Did you forget to clap?:) Not sure if serious... I can\\'t remember what episode it was, but a smackdown from late 2002, had one of the most unique backstage segments that I\\'ve ever seen wwe do. It was a continuous shot involving wrestlers from the main event to the undercard. I believe (but don\\'t hold me to it) It started with brock and Heyman walking looking for hulk hogan, then as they went into a room billy and chuck and Rico were seen talking and then Jamie noble and nidia walked by and the cameraman followed them, then hulk hogan walked into the shot where he proceeded to bump into Brock and Heyman. It was really neat to see this long uninterrupted shot involving various wrestlers in various feuds at the same time  Jerry Lawler I assume if Vince changes his tune  They\\'re just using the attention it has received in the mainstream media to try to grab a few viewers. Oh ok thanks! I still think he needs a new finisher. That knee just doesn\\'t work. It looks weak, and that\\'s the last thing you need from a finisher. It\\'s a real shame he lost the curb stomp. Unpopular opinion, I love the Digimon anime so much more than Pokemon. Pokemon\\'s plot always seemed more repetitive. Hey look! It\\'s Seth Rollins injuring someone! What a surprise! This is actually depressing as someone whose followed him since his CZW debut..  Why does *anyone* get booked as a main eventer when they\\'re not a big draw?\\n\\nAnswer: to let them grow and improve in the role and *become* the main event star the company figured when they put faith in that person.\\n\\nThe kind of question in the OP is exactly the same ignorance that permeates the sub when people say \"we want new main event stars that haven\\'t already headlined PPVs\" and then whine and complain when WWE puts someone like Jinder there and claims \"he\\'s not a big star, I don\\'t want that guy\".\\n\\nHow can anyone be a star if they\\'re not given the opportunity to prove their worth?\\n\\nBesides, the narrative that \"Jarrett was never a big draw\" is false, because plenty of my fellow WCW fans saw him as one and enjoyed his runs as a heel World champ. He slotted into that role perfectly and was the perfect foil to the babyfaces being given the opportunity to headline (namely, Booker T, or are we going to complain that *he* was never a big draw and didn\\'t deserve it, too?).\\n\\nLook at Triple H. Never that big a draw until he became The Game and proved himself as a top guy with the Evolution run. Team Cena:\\n\\nJohn Cena\\n\\nMatt Hardy\\n\\nJeff Hardy\\n\\nBraun Strowman\\n\\nJason Jordan\\n\\nvs.\\n\\n\\nTeam Reigns:\\n\\nRoman Reigns\\n\\nSeth Rollins\\n\\nDean Ambrose\\n\\nThe Big Show\\n\\nCesaro I really hated that gimmick. I thought it was a cool angle for a bit, but not something to build a whole gimmick around. Just cool pop words like \"the face that runs the place\" or \"the house that AJ Styles built.\" How is there going to be a Team Cena when WWE has Reigns destroy him at No Mercy, and he disappears for months to film some movie?\\n\\n**Ahhh Yessir!!** People love the Big Dawg! Where\\'s my jakked and metal though!?!? It would be a weird match. If each guy had to pick their own teams, idk if there are enough faces for it to make sense. But maybe it would look something like\\n\\nTeam Reigns:\\n\\nRoman Reigns\\n\\nDean Ambrose\\n\\nSeth Rollins\\n\\nThe Miz\\n\\nBig Show\\n\\nTeam Cena:\\n\\nJohn Cena\\n\\nMatt Hardy \\n\\nJeff Hardy\\n\\nBraun Strowman\\n\\nJason Jordan This is 2 different questions  Well, I hope this match wouldn\\'t happen, but if it did:\\n\\nTeam Cena: John Cena, Big Show, The Hardys, Finn Balor\\n\\nTeam Reigns: Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, Miz, Bray Wyatt\\n\\nRoman could obviously get the Shield back together, and if Rollins and Ambrose are feuding with the Hardys Cena could get them for his team.  Reigns picks Miz and Bray because they\\'re two people Cena has history with.  Cena picks Finn for his history with Rollins and Reigns.  Picks Big Show because they go way back and he trusts him.\\n\\nRegardless of what happens in the match, it sets up or teases a Mania match between Cena and Balor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpigjnKl7nI Everyone forgot about the 2nd half of it so i re-posted the 2nd half of the question  wow we picked nearly the exact same squads shock of all shocks LOL GFW So many people speaking out in a genuine tone. I mean, Wrestlecircus even went as far as to ban her from wrestling for them, I really doubt if it was a work it\\'d go that far. Bryan owed him that $10 fair and square. If you watch the video you can clearly see Bryan glance over to Tom *twice* before kicking him. It was a premeditated attack and it was disgusting. Ik no one talked about the other question so i re-posted the 2nd question  I was traveling in a bus full of people ,watching the episode on my laptop ... ive got couple of weird looks when i freakin marked out , but rocky was my favorite wreslter and i will always remember the way i absoltely lost it when i heard his music that night Ok think about it this way WrestleMania 21 was 2005..... Legacy started in 2008 Vince apparently has a longstanding policy against anyone thanking him in a HOF speech. Angle/Lesnar was WM19 Paul Jordan sent along the link to the following video, teasing that on next week\\'s Impact Wrestling, the company will recap the happenings of Triplemania with talents commenting on the Sexy Star-Rosemary incident.  Unless they are going to admit to the business being a work on their own television, which would be madness, it appears the company is going to turn the situation into a work.  \\n\\nA Link to said video https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=veB8aG3bW0U\\n\\nJohnson goes pretty in-depth into why if this is true then it is an absolutely stupid and horrendous decision for GFW to make. Personally I don\\'t think they will and it is only speculation based on a video but this is pro wrestling. I highly doubt it, probably just using it to promote the show and get people to watch  Roman isn\\'t going to destroy him. LMAO\\n\\n\\n\\nCena will atleast kick out of 3 spears and Roman kicks out of 3 AA . Similar to Brock vs Roman, where Roman kicked out of 3 F5 and Brock kicked out of 2 - 3 spears.\\n\\n It will be presented as super close match where they will  kickout of their finishers multiple times with Roman finally getting the win Me too Not really. If Batista knew Rollins was going to turn, I don\\'t think he\\'d have quit.\\n\\n What\\'s the context to the Marti situation ? I keep hearing \"she\"s arrogant\" but never much more Article:\\n\\n\"Paul Jordan sent along the link to the following video, teasing that on next week\\'s Impact Wrestling, the company will recap the happenings of Triplemania with talents commenting on the Sexy Star-Rosemary incident.  Unless they are going to admit to the business being a work on their own television, which would be madness, it appears the company is going to turn the situation into a work.  You can see the video below:\"\\n\\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veB8aG3bW0U)\\n\\n\"Note from Mike: I am speaking personally here, and not for PWInsider.conm, but if this is part of a plan to bring in Sexy Star for a grudge match against Rosemary, in my opinion, it\\'s a horrible, tawdry idea.  \\n\\nOne, it\\'s rewarding a talent for injuring someone else.   Why should Sexy Star get a payday over any other woman who works for GFW after what she did?\\n\\nTwo, it\\'s forcing the person who was injured to go back in the ring with someone they can\\'t trust.    What if Rosemary doesn\\'t want to do this?\\n\\nThree, it just comes off like the company is so devoid of ideas they need to latch onto anything that fans are talking about, while ignoring that all the talk revolved around disgust and outrage over the situation.   Therefore, they are not going to get the fans to then invest in seeing a match between the two.  Everyone involved should be better than this, especially given the collective wrestling mindset of the current creative team.  I get the idea of controversy creating cash, but will it? \\n\\nFour, even if GFW changes the parameter of what happened to fit a \"worked\" storyline, it\\'s an extremely insulting position to put Rosemary in, especially since she has publicly denounced Sexy Star as a liar and someone who took advantage of her.  Putting Rosemary into a story of that nature comes off looking like the company isn\\'t concerned about her well being, just about what they can get out of a bad situation.\\n\\nFive, even the company is aiming to add this story to say, Bound for Glory, it\\'s not going to add one buyrate because the audience buying that show is already buying it.  The entire premise will be based around a grudge of someone shooting when they should have been working, which means that every other match on the show is just going to be a work, so why should the audience care?  Is this going to make the company more money?  Even in Mexico?  If it happens at Universal, the audience gets in for free anyway.  I can\\'t see how this could be a gamechanger or even something that could make a major difference in rebuilding GFW/Impact, although I am sure someone from the company could argue otherwise.  I invite them to feel free to come on record with me and explain that mindset, if that is the case.\\n\\nOne can argue that people were emotionally pulled into the situation, but that\\'s because it was a legitimate situation.  The second the audience senses it\\'s work, they are not going to have that same level of investment.  They are going to look at it, shake their heads and move on.  \\n\\nSo, we will see how this transpires next week but the basic idea of this is something I see very little positives from and GFW needs more positives, not negatives - and this is not anything that is going to make fans sit up and take notice and feel like they need to spend money on the GFW brand.\" Role call Dont forget selfies. I\\'ll give it a look later. This guy is great. Put on one hell of a match with Bobby Fish at Beyond Wrestling Americanrana.  Theres a reason hes top 10 GOAT  Honestly giving him another person\\'s move was worse. He has a ton of moves that could be finishes.  The tag team of Xavier Woods and Pac ?  Also BL-APPLE when in Canada! Yeah and I love it. It\\'s forbidden to mention Vince at all during the Hall of Fame because he wants the weekend to be about the talent and not about the man behind the scenes.\\n\\nFor all the shit he gets around here, Vincent Kennedy McMahon has a heart of gold &gt; IC level in WWE was about right for him. \\n\\nUS level in WWE is about right for AJ Styles, too, since he peaked towards the end of his TNA run.\\n\\nYou see how that works, and how stupid you sound? I bet you\\'re one of those who cried for a new WWE main event star to be made and then cried again when Jinder got the nod. The first three episodes of the last season of GoT are Dany\\'s forces handily defeating Cersei\\'s in battle. In spite of this Cersei retains the Iron Throne due to these being non-Iron Throne battles.\\n\\n\\nThe Thursday following the third episode, @HBO tweets a link to an hbo.com article, suspiciously written as to appear like an independent blog post despite clearly being a piece of marketing material and hosted on HBO\\'s own website, and likely written by an unpaid hbo.com intern. The article states that this coming Sunday, episode four will feature a battle between Dany\\'s forces and Cersei\\'s, with the Iron Throne on the line.\\n\\n\\nEpisode four once again features Dany\\'s forces getting the better of Cersei\\'s army. As Dany, riding Drogon, flies over the walls of King\\'s Landing and toward the Red Keep. Cersei steps out onto a balcony, ready to meet her fate. Suddenly, a ridiculously peppy horn riff is heard below. It\\'s Jaime Lannister! Dany and Drogon slowly make a 180-degree turn, seemingly completely forgetting her objective and her enemy. As Dany is distracted by Jaime, Cersei orders The Mountain to, I dunno, like hurl an axe at Dany. It should be mentioned that The Mountain hadn\\'t appeared in any of the previous three episodes because he had been pulled to film an HBO Original Movie. The axe buries itself in Dany\\'s back and both she and Drogon crash to the ground, seemingly dead. Cersei has retained the Iron Throne!\\n\\n\\nEpisode five sees Dany resurrected by any of the people that that can do that. If you think it matters who, you\\'re dumb for wanting more consistency and better writing from this show. Anyway, Dany travels to King\\'s Landing and once again defeats The Queen of The Iron Throne. However, the Iron Throne was not the line. So, next week... Small WCW refs who died around the same time. I don\\'t think they really look that much alike but their stories are similar. LOLTNA  A little bit but to a much smaller degree  Except he crosses his feet. Every time a pro-wrestler takes the back and crosses his feet, I cringe so hard.  Yes, actually. A small one.\\n\\nNWA and then WCW Worldwide was shown on ITV in various regions. Sometimes very late on a Saturday with American Gladiators and then later on Sunday afternoons. \\n\\nThat\\'s how it was for viewers in the London Weekend Television region, anyway.\\n\\n Can someone please edit in Corey Graves yelling Kinshasa please! I love Mark Curtis btw R.I.P awesome ref from WCW/nWo Revenge I\\'d put that up with Sabu getting his arm ripped open wrestling Funk.  What are you talking about?! Bryan said he\\'d give Tom $10 if he watched Impact again, Tom watched Impact, Bryan owed him $10. It\\'s not Tom\\'s fault that Bryan failed to specify he meant watch Impact forever instead of for just one week. Breh, Cena couldn\\'t even kick out of Nakamura\\'s finishing move once. He\\'s never kicking out of 3 spears. At best, he\\'ll kick out of one, but this won\\'t be a super close match. Cena is being used as a stepping stone to Lesnar. They\\'re going to have Reigns annihilate him in there.  I used to watch WCW Worldwide in the UK in the early \\'90s. Their PPVs were sometimes available for rental and purchase. Their action figures were more widely available in the shops in my area than WWF Hasbro figures.\\n\\nIIRC, they had TV deals in Germany as well and were popular there. Yeah, I really cannot fucking approve of this if they\\'re gonna turn it into a storyline. I very much enjoy GFW despite some of their problems but this is something they shouldn\\'t even attempt to do. I really hope its just apart of the recap and nothing more. Who? So he\\'s a quack, then? It was a blatant act of cowardism, throwing himself towards Alvarez\\'s boot like that and trying to make him look like the villain.\\n\\nThe real heel is the promoter, not paying Alvarez so he could afford Mia Yim and Leva Bates. Jack Gallagher loses a retirement match and stops wrestling This is all just speculation atm - lets not take it as concrete fact yet. Should have written speculation in the title - my mistake. A part of that number is paying for cable tv carrying WWE products, which allows the cable provider to pay WWE for it.  That\\'s not what I\\'m doing at all, and I think you\\'re misunderstanding what I was saying.  Someone pointed out that GFW should get more recognition for something it\\'s doing.  I totally agree with that fact, but there\\'s a reality that a lot of people aren\\'t giving them recognition because they tuned out.  Stuff like this will help bring people back in, which as a company they need to continue and to survive.  That\\'s a good thing.   He walked out to Like A Prayer at UFC 196 as a tribute to Grado. You spelled his last name wrong. he fell flat on his fuckin\\' arse I give a shit, this is great news!  i mean it really is a great video &gt; Nia has improved\\n\\nHa ha, when? At what? Until one of them decided to screw the other over.  It\\'s just a question of which. &gt; I\\'d like to believe that the discussion about the lawsuit and CTE was being very corporate and protective of WWE and Corbin maybe as a former footballer call him out on it. Obviously I wasn\\'t there of course and have no freaking idea what so ever.\\n\\n\\nit also depends on how he brought this up, if it actually happened. putting your hand up and saying \"really? i was under the assumption that X\" is a lot different than saying \"well.. as a former football player i don\\'t think you have all of the facts straight..\" She does wrestle her own matches tho Hmm i agree but maybe he would do it if the price is right. Still i would like to see him do it. \"The general audience\" are the reason why Transformers movies make money. Fuck the general audience. 4 more seasons could take 7 years at this rate Legit! Live your fantasy. I love the yellow/black combo tbh but don\\'t be surprised if you get mistaken for one of them. Batista is in more high profile movies and better actor than hogan ever was.  Plus,  hogan is not even an actor anymore.  Rock was the other guy I was talking about, duh. OP here = Johnson just released a follow up to this \\n\\nhttp://www.pwinsider.com/article/112055/rosemary-vs-sexy-stargfw-addendum.html?p=1\\n\\nSince GFW released their video tease about the Sexy Star-Rosemary situation at Triplemania being covered on this week\\'s Impact Wrestling episode (and my commentary on why turning this into a storyline was such, in my opinion, a bad idea), it should be noted that two different GFW sources have reached out to PWInsider.com to state the company is not doing an angle with Sexy Star or planning on bringing her in.  \\n\\nWe are  told the company will be covering the incident, since it was such a big talking point among fans, but it is not part of a storyline leading to a match or anything of that natu involving Star vs. Rosemary.  Since the company is building to a GFW vs. AAA storyline, I can see how they could incorporate the incident into the thread of that story but in my mind, but it appears there will be no attempt of making money off Star shooting on Rosemary.\\n\\nSo GFW are not planning to do anything with Sexy Star. Sorry for jumping the gun guys. Smackdown episode and a  PPV match. Big difference \\n\\nSpear isn\\'t any protected move like dirty deeds. Most people have kicked out of it Is gnarly good or bad in this context?! Either way, thanks for listening! So let me get this straight. Corbin does this, and WWE decides to have John Cena come in and basically bury him so blatantly that everyone seeing it saw it as such. From clowning him on the mic to treating him like a joke in their match at Summerslam.\\n\\n(Heck, I don\\'t even think Corbin should be near the main event, but the whole process of that brief angle with Cena was crazy. It was designed to make Corbin look like a joke. From their segments to the match itself. It\\'s rare you see such a blatant burial.)\\n\\nYet John Cena is on Raw trying to claim he\\'s not burying anyone because he hasn\\'t been in the main event of Wrestlemania in 5 years. And you have a bunch of marks on here creaming themselves because he\\'s performing a scripted \"shoot\" on a guy they hate more, which in itself is those same marks being worked by the company they dislike. Since it\\'s all scripted.\\n\\nCena is just as much the corporate stooge today that he was 12 years ago. I mean that\\'s true but Lesnar/Orton was presented as a worked shoot that people took seriously, Sexy Star/Rosemary happened on the fly with no indication whatsoever it was a work.  You cannot walk around in something which does not exist. Psicosis, not Liger. Is that Dr.Evil? Daniel Bryan had an awesome character and was super over *going in* to Wrestlemania. Bayley has been handed shit, nothing but shit, for the past year. It\\'s not rocket science. Mojo Rawley squashing English on a post-WM house show this year. I don\\'t mind squashes but ugh, Mojo. We we have seen him and Paige naked together, so now I\\'m my head it is Bayley and Paige naked together... Such an intricate work getting wrestlers from all over the world, from super stars to mid carders to people behind the scenes to talk about this... for Sexy Star and Rosemary?\\n\\nI don\\'t think so. Any reason why?\\n\\nIsn\\'t that the technique MMA guys are taught to keep the grip when the opponent counters? Blutista is the best Batista  Throwing himself towards Alvarez\\'s boot??\\n\\nWILL YOU STOP?! Its a opinion based question how is it unanswerable unless you dont know how good they are or how much of legends they are  [The scene so typically Scottish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nugmBqZ_S3c#t=18s) Graves is the only good heel commentator in WWE right now, and although I\\'d much rather have him with Byron, he\\'s much more suited on Raw with Cole beside him to continue grooming him as the next top guy at the booth.  Number of months as champion - 6.\\nNumber of clean defenses - 0.\\n\\nYou mean to tell me this kind of booking will not get a champion over? Hollywood Heel Batista was the best Batista. true, the fact that there was legit shooting also tells me its more of a shoot. the only concrete thing i can think of is that itd be irresponsible  of them to let star\\'s name dragged so far in the mud (even to miss bookings) for a work (greatest work of all time if true but still) The anticipated return of Colonel Ziggler I think ric flair would he THE DIRTIEST PLAYER IN THE GAME WOOOO He\\'s their medical director, but Chris Amann is their ringside physician on the road. A small foothold but not anything to Big though with WCW worldwide they at least had the option. Absolutely not. Crossing your feet from rear-mount allows for a very easy, and very effective ankle lock. If you really want to control the person, you can cross one leg over their stomach and figure-four your legs. \\n\\nThe best way to maintain control is to use your thighs to grip and control pressure, and to hook your feet behind your opponents knees, or thighs and lift your feet like a hooking motion.  Anakin Skywalker, you can go to hell. Chihiro Hashimoto vs Alexa Bliss.\\nKinda wanna see rookie champs against each other Dude she\\'s brand new. Cut her a little slack. A golden demon paint would look great as a one-off. Yeah, what\\'s up, doc? Undertaker returns unannounced, only to kidnap Roman Reigns, as druids attack, place Reigns in a coffin and wheel him off. Over the next few weeks at random points, the bell tolls, the arena darkens, and we get video footage of Undertaker at work in what looks like Paul Bearer\\'s old funeral parlour. Taker is talking to someone but we never see who. Finally, at the Rumble, Taker makes his appearance at number 30, walks slowly to the ring, covered in near darkness and with his trademark hat and hair covering his face... only to reveal Reigns as the new version of the Undertaker, who proceeds to clear the ring using Taker\\'s moves, winning the Rumble AGAIN. Yeah, YOU would. Totally disagree. Yeah, there are some good technical matches I  guess, but there was not a single memorable match at WM this year except for maybe Goldberg/Lesnar lol. Yeah, Rollins/HHH and Taker/Reigns were long but so boring and in front of a dead crowd. At Summerslam the main event was very good but besides that I wouldn\\'t say there was anything else memorable. There\\'s just something missing at any of these events these days. Although it is better than the period from like 2003 to 2012 which was just consistently awful.  Mr. Fuji. *throws salt in face* Pretty much the entirety of Extreme Reunion. But there\\'s no other Samoan in that match I thought it was called The V-Trigger? Where am I getting that from? They put spikes facing outwards on the outside part of the cage, so when the ring collapses, the cage splits apart and falls down into the crowd, instantly killing everybody in the first three-to-four rows with the cage spikes.\\n\\nAt some point, this is just an episode of Metalocalypse. No I did not, but Piscatelli once gave up a 65 yard td to Todd Heap.  Todd fucking Heap.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hd55AUkNwU\\n\\nPiscatelli is 21.  He creeps forward then just runs in a circle.  Todd Fucking Heap, the slowest fucking TE I\\'ve seen just runs past everyone and Piscatelli fucking runs in a circle confused while everyone else realizes how badly he fucked up. Most people want babyface tag team and they don\\'t want Sami to turn heel Wait. Was the finish really changed midmatch? Gotta agree that her match sucked though, probably the only match i was tuned out of I agree there\\'s something missing and a lot is forgettable, but most of the matches are still an improvement from what they used to be.  future ace right there. Everybody\\'s talking about White Wolf - they made a great first impression!  Indian Youtube numbers\\n\\nBut given some time in the PC I think Kavita could be great The show air date was 9-9-2008, the show itself happened in august at some time as they were holding their Summer Adventure Tag League II which happened between August 9th and August 28th.\\n\\nHere\\'s a few extra pics from the show that I managed to grab of them setting the \"ring\" up.\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mQey4\\n Less scripted\\nMore boobies\\nMore blood The title said matches you\\'ve *seen* Carny ass carnies. Braun is too good now so this wouldn\\'t work anymore. But back when both Braun and Nia were doing the short jobber squash matches, I would have loved if in one episode their squashes would have been back to back. So after, say, Braun squashes jobber #9, Nia would have her turn but squash her jobber before Braun is in the backstage area and Braun would just watch in awe.\\n\\nAnd then they would make some monster love. Love me some Eli Drake. Hope he gets more time on the mic. One of the best promos in wrestling, top 5 in GFW Oh he knows alright. Goldust selling an eye poke through his glasses This is the man GFW needs. They better not fuck it up. Please, tell me the ratings of the UK...Japan....India....\\n\\nNever on the internet - including this sub - have I ever seen someone going \"The UK viewership is down. THAT\\'S WHY THEY\\'RE DO SO BADLY!!!\"\\n\\nIt\\'s always been US numbers, US dollars, US viewers, US products...\\n\\nWe rate based on US markets. They spend the vast majority of their time in the US. They depend on the US contracts.\\n\\nUS is the most important market for the WWE, ELSE they\\'d quickly be in other markets much more heavily than what they ever tried to do.  Good riddance.  *shyuuup* here we go Ah, ok. Thanks.  I think people should just wait till the episode actually airs before jumping to conclusions. If it\\'s just a recap, fine. I highly doubt they\\'re gonna spin this into a storyline considering these tapings were done before Triplemania though. Looked like it. Jessika Carr talked briefly with Rachel, then went over to talk to Marti and shortly after the roll-up happened. you changed it and posted it That was the 2nd ECW match I ever saw. Sabu was like, \"fuck it. Pass the medical tape Fonz!\" Exactly. So far jinder hasn\\'t budged the network subs at all.  They will watch but not pay Probably worried about being put into the league of nations v2 She\\'s her own entity, rather than playing the shy timid \\'superfan\\' character.\\n\\nMore on the level of Sami Zayn i\\'d say.   Especially how well she sold the strain on her elbow the entire match. I think it was on a Stone Cold podcast that Flair said Vince loaned him something like $850,000 (not all at once, in installments). After his retirement match with HBK, Flair said he was handed his check (a \"big\" one) and he immediately endorsed it and handed it to Vince to pay off his debt. It wouldn\\'t be the greatest work of all time. It would be ruining a major match in another companies biggest show and permanently the damaging GFW\\'s reputation with every other promotion and hundreds of wrestlers to create an angle that won\\'t draw any money. He\\'s a couple of inches shorter than Sami Zayn who\\'s 6ft, so he\\'s probably more like 5\\'10, but compared to most that\\'s not overstretching his height much (especially given he\\'d easily measure it in wrestling boots)  I imagine this won\\'t even be seen or will be chosen to be ignored since it doesn\\'t fit the \"DAE LOLGFW XDDDDD\" circlejerk  5\\'10\" | 1.78 metres  \\n6 ft | 1.83 metres\\n\\n^metric ^units ^bot ^| ^[feedback](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=cannawen&amp;subject=metric%20units%20bot&amp;message=I%20think%20your%20bot%20is...%20%5BPlease%20include%20a%20link%20if%20you%20are%20reporting%20a%20bug%20about%20a%20specific%20comment!%5D) ^| ^[source](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot) ^| ^[block](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=metric_units&amp;subject=stop&amp;message=If%20you%20would%20like%20to%20stop%20seeing%20this%20bot%27s%20comments%2C%20please%20send%20this%20private%20message%20with%20the%20subject%20%27stop%27.%20If%20you%20are%20a%20moderator%2C%20please%20go%20to%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FSquaredCircle%2Fabout%2Fbanned%2F) ^| ^v0.7.9 Do a sad Kurt Angle Kavita Dai definitely has some potential.

I can\\'t decipher which fued had what matches I think Sad Kane would work well. If you\\'re into NJPW, Sad Naito would be a good choice. Wait, he died? Aww..\\n\\n[EDIT: Fuck, back in 1999? I\\'m observant..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hildebrand) Vader had the same thing happen in a match against Stan Hansen IIRC, and it actually came out of the socket and he.... just pushes it back in. I\\'m sorry, but if my eyeball comes outside of my dome, I\\'m finished, and probably screaming like a baby.  Where is this from? **Mamma Mia !** Kurt Angle. Reigns, Ambrose, Rollins and Usos v Cena, Hardys and New Day  If WWE isn\\'t turning Reigns heel, then they aren\\'t going to align him with a team of heels. Although it would be more entertaining than a straight one-on-one match between them, that\\'s for sure. Okada  WHY CAN\\'T FRUIT BE COMPARED? Thing is WWE would have never let him develop into this. People like Drake, EC3, Rosemary, Matt Hardy,etc have developed because of Impact\\'s technique of letting the talent have room to be creative within the outlines of the booking. wwe doesn\\'t really do that anymore, not since the attitude era. It\\'s not a big deal without the NXT Champion, Universal Champion, or the WWE Champion involved in that match as well Source?! I don\\'t know how more people don\\'t see this coming.  Braun\\'s the new Beast; the Monster.  \\n\\n\\nI mean it literally already happened to Brock with Big Show in his previous run... I mean, Enzo\\'s \"burial\" has probably been the most airtime he\\'s ever gotten in his career. He\\'s been in numerous RAW opening/closing segments and gotten to expand on his character he never did in the tag team with Cass. But I don\\'t think anyone really questioned if they were trying to bury Enzo or not. Same here I\\'m a Fallah bah fan No he has not resigned. There may of been talks but they went no where.\\n\\nAlex is currently working on GLOW and several other acting gigs. I almost wonder if Terry just didn\\'t experience pain the same way others do. Maybe his pain receptors were dulled or something. The legend is that he WOULD NOT sell an injury backstage no matter how brutal. He\\'d just grin and say, \"Helluva match! Thanks!\" Bruce Prichard actually talked about this on his podcast. I\\'d love to, pretentious fuckwad. Ever listen to his solo stuff? Jesus. All the Canadians are in GFW :P No wonder why his mic skills is usually entertaining  There was a report a few weeks ago that WWE wasn\\'t interested in Rey and that GFW had made him an offer.  I loved Tony myself. The only times he was terrible were when he was forced to say weird things during the Monday night wars Love Brian Hildebrand... \\n\\nhe saw that fan coming a mile away too. Kinshasa into a front choke... RIP Brian Well, if this happens I think we have a strong contender for WON\\'s Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic  It was already injured before the match. They just kayfabed it with the match Basically only PWG, Lucha Underground, hoodslam, and dragon gate. Other than that only highlights posted here or /wooo/ Ah the Buckfast Flair Flop so seldom seen. This is a 100% amazing use for this sub and a super positive way of contributing to the community, thank you for organising it. Well this is rather boring.  Nor did he ever claim that it was. It was simply speculation, something we all did because we didnt know what happened. Funny how you shoot down Meltzer and not r/SC, when clearly both fueled that claim.\\n\\nAnd call me a suck up to Meltzer, thats fine, I just wanna throw that out there because I might be one of the only people here that actually regularly listens to WOR and not just word of mouth via here, which typically overstates things he says as they go from person to person.\\n\\n\"Meltzer says Barons push is gonna crack any minute purple monkey dishwasher\" Tuck. Your. Chin. I\\'m really impressed by this guy. I feel like he\\'s going to be the next Okada at the rate he\\'s going. Wish I understood Japanese because the twitter auto translate thing really suck.  That\\'s GNC. G E E K How he is still able to wrestle is beyond me Good bot G|E|E|K|\\n-|-|-|-|\\nE|E| | |\\nE| |E| |\\nK| | |K|\\n not necessicarily. i mean sexxy star could\\'ve legit ruined the major math with only the intention of doing the work/shoot finish on rosemary. also if this was a work i would think it would bring more promotion eyes on the company. in an age where working the fans is a rarity to pull off something like this would be top tier  Much better than the stabbings this past month it don\\'t matter, he left in the first place because they weren\\'t treating him right.\\n\\nhe was mr. tna for over a decade before he left... eh whatever. Doug Dillinger was the most useless security person ever...in Bret Hart\\'s book he explains that his ring gear kept getting stolen by randon people just wondering into the locker room and taking things, so Bret just started showing up in jean shorts, sneakers and his Hitman Hockey jersey.\\n\\nHe said if WCW didn\\'t give fuck then he wouldn\\'t either,  Now that I think about it, Angle definitely countered the sleeper into an ankle lock the way you described against a few opponents. This is objectively wrong af. N this is coming from somebody that worships Alexa\\'s booty. I would eat that all day and totz cum on her face. But objectively no woman on the roster can compare to Eva Marie on a poster as far as hotness. She\\'s 5\\'8 which is model height. Big fake titties which looks great pushed up. Slim perfect shaped toned legs. Plus she\\'s got that typical hot jersey Italian girl look going which always in demand. Feel free to disagree but honestly you\\'d be wearing the Alexa goggle too hard Nope. \\n\\nHe\\'s a heel. No fans are getting frustrated. In the sense of Corbin\\'s story all that happened is he got his comeuppance. Ascension and Corbin are not in the same league for that to be considered a valid comparison.  Probably Masa Oh yeah. A lot of Belzarian\\'s money is family though. I know top Instagram models make money but that dude is so full of shit it\\'s hard to take anything he says seriously. This would be an amazing move in an anime tbh Am I the only one who didnt know if this was RL or the UFC game for atleast a good 10 seconds? Hottest week of the year here in Los Angeles. As much as I would have loved to watch this live I\\'m pretty thankful I didn\\'t get tickets. But you can bet your ass I\\'ll be there for the next event. LOL it\\'s about Charlotte, NC  Last time he was on (about a month ago) I thought he looked fucking great. A bit over zealous and sloppy, but definitely on his way. you can try to delete it but we still know its you.  Maybe his CTE caused the outburst. Mr. Get My ~~Shit~~ Syringe In  it would probably help them and they wouldn\\'t need to go after the title Jeff Jarrett gotta Jeff Jarrett was the puder hazing turned into a storyline? i cant remember anything bout him except when he went full lesner on kurts arm. idk the idea of turning what was once one ofyour companies top talent\\'s screw job into storylines not only for vince to geta major heel run but also for one of bret\\'s own family is kinda revolting &gt;She really isn\\'t as good as a talker as people say she is. At times her delivery can feel forced and unconvincing.\\n\\nSame can be said for Sasha and Charlotte but yet I don\\'t see you saying it.  But that\\'s because you hate Bliss and mark for the 4HW. \\n\\n&gt;It just is mind boggling to me that they chose her to get this big super push \\n\\nTIL \"Big Super Push\"  means not winning on TV for 2 months and losing to Sasha and Bayley multiple times in that span\\n\\n&gt;Those 4 changed the game\\n\\nThey really didn\\'t.  There have been better women wrestlers before them, there are currently better women wrestlers now and there will be better women wrestlers after them.    They were the beneficiaries of a WWE agenda.  \\n No one claimed that it makes sense but to assume that everytime a questionable decision gets made it\\'s a burial or it\\'s because there\\'s gotta be heat on someone is getting old. There always has to be a loser, everyone can\\'t win or lose the same way they\\'ve always won or lost. \\nDo I agree with the way they took the briefcase? Not really. But do I assume it\\'s because he fucked up somewhere along the line? Nope. \\n He has also been tagging quite a lot alongside randy orton. Beautiful. Ciampa and Gargano are basically destined for 205. I have a good hunch that Gargano is only staying down there until Ciampa is healthy enough to return. Once Ciampa is good to go Gargano will go up and either win the CW belt (after a 2-3 month feud with whoever has it) or immediately start a fued with Ciampa who attacks him after his first match. There\\'s always debate over Vince\\'s infamous \"brass ring\" and whether it\\'s really possible for wrestlers to break out if he\\'s so controlling. I think this is a good example of how some guys pull it off. Like KO says, he found a way to inject who he is into the segments without forgetting to push the angle or the match, and now he\\'s trusted to do promos without so much hand holding. Part natural talent, part luck because he was paired with Jericho. But at the same time, he was smart enough to seize that opportunity and not shoot himself in the foot by putting himself over. Are they wrestlers who are also wredditors? Who cares  Why can\\'t the business ever consider this? Do they have such little respect for wrestling fans that they think that this is what is wanted? Dude how many of these are you going to post? 🤔🤔🤔 She developed the gimmick before she got to Impact. They probably own her name though.  Yes. Or Cesaro\\'s push and non-push before her. \\nBad booking leads to frustration. Absolutely. I agree with that 1000%. I watch less now than I ever did because of it. But I don\\'t think that Sasha\\'s role or Cesaro\\'s role then were because of any heat they\\'ve had.  Vintage WCW. Summerslam 1996 Because they have other bodies that can do that.  Link story &gt; I dont remember that one Ishii and his eternally injured shoulder.  Who are they? Recently I suppose AJ has been more active. So lots of T Shirts, hats, fidget spinner/toys etc based on what he\\'s currently doing. \\n loved her strawberry red hair at the time and wish she\\'d go back to it once turn heel Ok, I know your posts are kayfabe, but I really wish people would stop forgetting/ignoring that Becky and Charlotte are fueding with Tamina and Lana. Just because they\\'re not in the title picture doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not being used  Not to mention the family members and impending potential tragedies. Being hit in the head hurts the brain. Who woulda thunk it?! O F T H E W E E K I don\\'t necessarily think it\\'s a work. It would be stupid of them not to capitalize on the mainstream exposure the incident received. \\n Thanks!  Before Maryse came back, I would\\'ve loved his valet to be Eva Marie.  Yep and he shills sugar pills to housewives on daytime TV. Clearly me and my alts riled this guy up something fierce. Oh nice! 2015 is my favorite Seth Rollins but I do not remember their matches at that time, I gotta rewatch Right? Read that and thought \"Gee, I hope the ring itself is okay.\" Care to explain the joke? I didnt understand it tbh Nah.\\n\\nCall it Regicide.   Still holding the fanny pack I see? Gotta keep up that gimmick. He\\'s just jealous. Tomohiro Ishii. Is capable of having a great match with literally everyone, including Yujiro Takahashi.  \"Filthy\" Tom *LAWLOR*\\n\\nStupid auto correct making me out to be a geek! I just keep imagining those two outside seeing it in slow motion and regretting every bad decision they\\'ve ever made as they see this refrigerator flying through the air at them. Mike Elgin is the human iteration of a Metal Gear. Obviously Suzuki is the coolest motherfucker on the planet. Right to Censor  1. Lower the crowd lights like NXT or New Japan. It gives it a cooler, less clean look plus you eliminate the annoying crowd antics since you can\\'t see them clearly.\\n\\n2. Give a bullet point script to people who are good at improv and ad-libbing, but also a full script to people who need it. Don\\'t just give a word for word script to everyone.\\n\\n3. Let wrestlers wrestle different styles, I\\'m so sick of watching 3, maybe 4 hour ppvs where all the matches feel the same and wrestling the same styles. This way you eliminate the need of overusing gimmick matches and actually save them for special occasions. He wanted to do the full thing, bumbag and all, but the whole Reebok thing put the kibosh on it (according to Tom at the time, iirc) Booker to smackdown frees up a spot on raw and Cole already loves working with Nigel. Then we\\'re just one change away. The plastic line got me lol I hope so.  All you misogynistic assholes would have a lot of apologizing to do. Yeah, forgot about that actually. Reebok deal really holds fighters back. yeah my gut instinct reading this is that Corbin\\'s in the right here, and was calling the guy out on his bullshit Nice to know!  I think he also had a pretape during the build for \"Battle of the Billionaires\" *El gran Miguel you gringo Please don\\'t remind me of that. That shit was so fucking annoying. AND SUPERSTARS! THERE\\'S SO MUCH MISSING RETRO PLOT IN THERE! Just because other people have done it in the past does it excuse this specific instance which is deplorable as well. Vince got a shit ton of bad press from the screwjob and everything following it. Wow... That was sad... What would be the most logical way to give information to your weekly shows fans? The show itself? or a 3rd party social media website? \\n\\nA normal tv show retains viewership via many tactics like:\\nHaving previews of next weeks episode at the end of this weeks, or the next fight card, or the next race/match whatever, having storylines that continue over, cliffhangers etc. \\n\\nThese tactics i think have provided more results than whatever the WWE is doing lately. So thats why i think this is bad. God this thread sucks. \\n\\n\"GFW has no honor dammit! How could they sully the good non carny world of wrestling!!!\" \\n\\nYet many say\\n\\n\"That Matt Hardy/Edge storyline was amazing! I loved how they made it feel so real by using real heat.\" Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose, Current tag title reign should end on WM34 Is there anything in the gold dust gimmick that Dustin didn\\'t want to be a Rhodes? Has he talked about it? /u/JustATributeCC - Roman Reigns\\n\\n/u/ItsaScreamBaby24 - John Cena Well he went from being Mr. Mitb and a feud with Cena. Then losing the briefcase in a chumpstain way and losing to Cena. Now he\\'ll likely lose to Styles to build him up.\\n\\nFrom \"Next World Champ\" to \"Enhancement for US title\"... yeah that seems like a lost push to me. [Sad Bud Dwight] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-hURIxydDE) **E** **LI** **DRAKE** Likewise, people watch UFC and cheer Connor McGregor even if they aren\\'t from Ireland. You never know with these things.  A lot of people do say \"take my money\" but when the situation comes, they become stingy and frugal.  The risk of going straight to an 18,000 capacity venue after doing 2,000 doesn\\'t outweigh the reward for me. The ankle lock I mentioned isn\\'t even using your hand. You simple lift your own thigh over top of the top foot of the crossed feet, and apply pressure to the top of it. The bottom ankle traps the top ankle, allowing your thigh to over-extend the foot, and put pressure on the ankle. \\n\\nIt\\'s something they teach you in the first couple of days of Brazilian jujitsu/grappling, but not something you\\'d really learn in Greco, freestyle, or Judo, so a lot of pro-wrestlers without a BJJ background still cross their feet. \\n\\nYou don\\'t see it happen in MMA very often, although there was recently a video on /r/MMA of someone catching that submission, and the fighter got thoroughly roasted for it. \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/6p8hnc/dont_cross_your_feetlegs_when_you_take_the_back/ And he\\'s just as much of a vindictive petty asshole as he was back then, and since then, as well.  I\\'m no fan of Reigns either, but my dislike for him is nowhere even close to what I have for Cena. Sorry one of the options isnt: NONE THEY HAVE ALL SUCKED People really love to jump the gun. Let the thing play out and then decide if it\\'s a bad idea, there is no way you can predict how a 2 hour television show can pan out via a 16 second preview  This can work. Owens still only has the Pop-Up Powerbomb (and had the Package Piledriver before that) and Nash only had the Jacknife Powerbomb for years. I\\'d love for Jerry to go back to his heel days as an announcer on SD. This is true.... But often coal miners are born into that professional. It\\'s the whole \"product of your own environment\" and many of these workers don\\'t know anything else because that\\'s what they were taught growing up their whole life.  Fan-fucking-tastic. Funniest part is it wouldn\\'t have registered with non wrestling fans. What a man. They teased this is Baron Corbin. They already came out and said that it is specific to Smackdown.  These replies are hilarious It\\'s cool, I loved a lot of objectively awful WWF content. Sad no chance in hell and Sad DX theme is a must.  Superstaaaaaaars I mean, I disagree with the majority of your original comment but I really don\\'t care enough for nerves to be touched. \\n\\nWhat I disagreed with most was the idea that Squared Circle is cancerous and the most toxic sub on reddit - even within the bracket of \"normal subs about normal things\" I think this is a pretty average, normal sub.  It\\'s okay Truth. It\\'s okay. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Garza Jr. starts getting pushed. He\\'s a future star. \" The fact that for the better part of 35 years, the company has treated women as objects instead of athletes, constantly put them in the most degrading storylines, \"\\nTrish Stratus, Victoria, Molly Holly, Jazz, Paige, Lita, Paige, Luna, Chyna and AJ lee says hi.\\n\\n\" Watch this and tell me how you think you\\'d feel as a female wrestler working for the company\"\\n\\nI can counter point by saying look how they treated Trish Stratus in her retirement. \\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbwGuVJZT0\\n \\nThey did that to Lita because she had heat and was not very liked backstage at that time. Not because she was a woman like you are you trying to imply. \\n\\n\" It basically took Ronda Rousey being an MMA draw before the WWE said \"Huh, maybe female athletes are actually a thing that can make money.\"\\n\\nTrish Stratus, Molly Holly, Victoria, Chyna, lita were female athletes that could draw before the whole divas revolution.\\n\\n\\nDo you genuinely believe if Lita, or Trish, or Beth Phoenix, or Victoria went to Vince and tried to establish an open channel with him that he\\'d actually listen? If so, what reason do you have to believe that?\\n\\nYes.

Yep! They are set to have a SMASHING revival soon, hopefully the clock doesn\\'t strike 12 though, turning them back into PUMPKINS. Hes retired. All I could think of when watching this was Walter from The Big Lebowski. They\\'re not wrong, they\\'re just assholes I\\'d rather they not mention it at all. But I could see someone talking about it in a work sense. She had already won the match but tried to hurt Rosemary afterward. It would fit in with some of what coming up in the taping spoilers. This is like the fifth or sixth \"the move that..\" post So there\\'s a chance that, one day, it will be back WCW was on channel 5. This is how I found them. turned on randomly and saw the graveyard match sting vs vampiro promo package  Send Vince to Antarctica - 1 way ticket. Full gym, steak wraps, steroids &amp; supplies for life and can never leave. \\n\\n\\nThat it\\'s. I will give my other 2 choices if this one can be done.  Work it in to the storyline that they made the mistake of not stating this in the women\\'s MITB contract by accident.  This comment made me ashamed to have a comment in this thread.  WWE Version\\n\\n\"The WWE Universe is in the ring!\"\\n\\nOr...\\n\\n[close up shot] ... ... \"Is that the Demon King? ... Is that the Demon King?! ... ... ha ha ha ha ha!\" im not saying it does just that this isnt a tna/gfw thing but a prowrestling thing &gt; but it appears there will be no attempt of making money off Star shooting on Rosemary.\\n\\nThey are doing that right now by using it to promote their show I read tweeters as teenagers real quick and was like whoa that\\'s edgy.  He\\'s so nude  You can\\'t stand that some people enjoyed her doing something? How sad and pathetic are you and which 4HW do you mark for?

Fuck Maroon. Maybe they brought them to Smackdown, to take away some of RAW\\'s stars, which might cause RAW fans to watch SD Live? Or maybe they had plans, but they fell through. The rules series was good up until the guy posting it decided to just make it death match spots rather than bad looking botches. They were great too, especially Heenan I got speared on the street, that fucking hurt, but luckily I just fell on my back and not on my head or some shit \"Well....bye.\\'   Layeth - Verb\\n(archaic) third-person singular simple present indicative form of lay\\n\\n That wouldn\\'t make sense. \\n\\nAlso, what sense does it make to eliminate one of the women\\'s titles? Unless you are planning on bringing the entire women\\'s division to Smackdown, this is not a good idea.  Or just have Mahal drop it ASAP instead  So Vince didn\\'t want his Bad Guy champion to be the face of the company with the title. Ok. Don\\'t put the belt on him till Raw then. \\n\\nHe\\'s a bad guy. He\\'s not suppose to be a squeaky clean babyface champion.  LOOK AT THE ADJECTIVE:LAY! Man, that round the world Helluva Kick is slick as fuck. It happens in wrestling too, some of today\\'s biggest stars are third generation wrestlers. The Rock, Natty, Orton, etc., not to mention prolific wrestling families like the Harts or Anoa\\'i. &gt; Are there people starting to watch right not for whom Jinder Mahal is the best heel ever?\\n\\nDon\\'t be so pessimistic, *surely* not...right? Right?!\\n &gt; The IC Title is retired\\n\\nThis is a worse idea than OP\\'s.  Google \"Drive By\" and you will see guys shooting out of a car..   \\n[This one](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1339437241_drive-by-education.jpg) is especially bad Cheers. We are done here.  Hero He wrestles live events doesn\\'t he? Fair enough That is the idea. Both women\\'s rosters are extremely shallow. Almost all possible matches have taken place. A merged roster benefits everyone.  Holy shit, he needs to not retire. The pleather outfit makes him look so out of shape. Dude could easily update his costume to something like in the pic and become a revitalized badass, legit threat Goldust. They could do that.\\n\\nNow, why would they want to? As far as I can tell they have a lot of women across both brands who deserve screen time and are strugling to get it. This problem is only likely to get worse if Paige returns, Asuka ascends and so on.\\n\\nYour idea inevitably leaves the women with even less screen time. Unless we just make Smackdown the show that only has women\\'s wrestling but I doubt that\\'s happening.\\n\\nSo, why? He had an entire feud with lufisto during his original Indy days...  It\\'s ugly, but audiences don\\'t prove him wrong. You got one audience that loves that stupid shit, and another that complains about it but still watches it anyway. The incentives just aren\\'t there outside of personal decency, and when has the WWE ever made choices around what\\'s right instead of what makes them money? I mean, we could probably solve this pretty quickly if everyone who thinks it\\'s stupid just stopped watching/going to Smackdown Live and was vocal about why. There\\'s probably people in the company arguing against this kind of thing, and nobody is giving them something to point to in order to win that argument. Oh no the ancient god sealed within John Cena\\'s body has gotten loose! We need to combine the entire locker room\\'s power to defeat it. Oh I didn\\'t I even noticed I am getting downvoted and this thread has already been deleted lol. Imagine being a female talent being evaluated by him. Creeps  How is hating someone for intentionally trying to legit injure anothet wrestler irrational? My only issue so far is that I have a lot I wanna post right now but I feel like I should space it out a bit. I also already have the last one ready. I don\\'t have a dog in this fight, I haven\\'t read or heard anything from Maroon\\'s POV. My post was purely from reading the OP post. Great film. If anything Inside Edition did do a lot of fair research, and got McMahon with a \"gotcha\" question in regards to the prostitution thing. Saying they\\'re \"ho\\'s\" instead of prostitutes is a lot worse. But there still is the biggest factor which of course they left out cause \"fuck personal responsibility amirite\"? Why do they not ask the parents as to why they allow their children to watch something like this. Clearly this is something that shouldn\\'t be shown to kids, and yet, that\\'s a good portion of their audience as they stated. So why do they blame Vince instead of the parents for allowing their kids to watch this.  if you guys are mad now that your favorites (4HW) aren\\'t being used well, imagine how pissed you are all going to get when there\\'s only one title that will probably revolve only around Alexa &amp; Charlotte.  African American Ranger Stop 205 and have them on Raw and Smackdown\\n\\nUnite Women on Raw and Tag on Smackdown\\n\\nVince doesn\\'t have the final word on everything  You get a Z Pak!\\n\\nYou get a Z Pak!\\n\\nYou get a Z Pak!\\n\\nYou get a Z Pak!\\n\\nYou get a Z Pak! I just want him to be a face. He was hilarious as Handsome Rusev. [A fan tried to jump Stone Cold and HHH beat the ever-loving fuck out of him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsCt6K_OYqE) The ref even gets in on it. I never understood his push. Nothing about the guy wants to make me turn on the t.v.  2016\\n\\nAJ Styles debut and he became WWE Champion\\n\\nKevin Owens becoming Universal Champion\\n\\nThe Revival vs DIY have a MOTY @ Takeover Toronto\\n\\n There\\'s normally a decent sized segment / match for the Cruiserweights on Smackdown. I\\'ve always thought that 205 live should be cancelled, make the cruisers a Raw exclusive and the Women\\'s division a SD exclusive. This is just my personal opinion.  It\\'s the Miz-taaay! No, I read your entire poorly thought out idea. I could have stopped at retiring the IC title, though. It didn\\'t get redeemed. Why eliminate one of the big titles? It isn\\'t needed.  Garza Jr. and Laredo Kid are from The Crash in Mexico. Not sure about specifics but I think they\\'re one of the newer promotions in Mexico. Not sure where they found Fallah Bah. The go home show to Summerslam for Raw this year was really good.  Huh? He is talking about the first 3 months of his career Well i guess that Devi is winning the womens belt on raw this monday. I know you\\'re joking but Kendrick said he\\'s off drugs now. He likes his WWE employment more than he does being high. So since this thread is full of people bashing the company for what turned out to be a lie, how about we call this a \"LolGFWHaters\" situation. They did that last year for his 2nd NXT Championship win though  Well, \"layeth\" is a verb, based off \"lay\" as in \"to lay down.\" The Rock modified the verb to indicate a third person, singular, simple present indicative, by adding an uncommon suffix, \"-eth.\" Let\\'s break that down.  \\n  \\nThe Rock does not refer to himself as \"I\", or \"I, The Rock\", but instead \"The Rock\", in the third person viewpoint.  \\n  \\nSingular means that it is referring to one individual completing the action. This individual is The Rock, and the action is the smack being laid down.  \\n  \\n\"The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present tense when an action is happening right now, or when it happens regularly or unceasingly\" (thx grammarly)  \\n  \\nIndicative in this instance means a verb that states a fact or simple assertion.  \\n  \\nSmacketh is a bastardization of the \"-eth\" suffix, a pretty uncommon and archaic holdover unless people are trying to sound like the King James Bible. The proper way would be \"The Rock lays the smack down\" or \"Layeth the smacks down\" but those sound less imposing. Fuck cm punk  He was one of Jericho\\'s old friends along with [Malenko, Guerrero and Benoit.](http://i.imgur.com/gWC0jT6.jpg)\\n\\nSadly only two of the crew left now. Probably the best lumberjack match ever. I remember when the stipulation was announced, everyone was worried it would be either a shit show or a pointless stipulation because lumberjack matches are basically never good.\\n\\nThen the match blew away everyone\\'s expectations. They found a lot of creative ways to incorporate the wrestlers outside into the match. I miss his Darth Maul look. Demon Goldust should be a thing. J-A-double R-E-double T!!! Suzuki DOES follow him tho, but not in a way he\\'d like. &gt; There\\'s normally a decent sized segment / match for the Cruiserweights on Smackdown.\\n\\nNo there isn\\'t. The Cruiserweights are only on Raw/205 Live. Which I\\'d normally chalk up to a simple mistake. But the rest of your comment suggests that you want to remove the cruiserweights from Smackdown... which they aren\\'t on. I don\\'t get it. NIGEL!! I saw a Renee rumor as well . But I definitely want Mauro. Idk how he and Phillips would work though since they\\'re both play by play I\\'m pretty sure this is like the 5th one this week  Brock Lesnar during his first run. Yeah, look to his Austin match at WM14 to see the injury starting to take it\\'s toll, if I recall he walks in a very awkward manner throughout the fight to keep his back in a manageable place. Not only would that be a clusterfuck, but it would be hard to watch - at home and in person I remember when they did Cena &amp; Orton vs. RAW roster (most, I don’t think all). That’s when I seen Cena throw a guy into the air for Orton to RKO.  All the people on Old school Raw got too old to work. Even the wrestlers from the Attitude Era are approaching their 50s now.  That\\'d be an improvement. John Cena, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar and The Shield join forces and start a millennial era version of the nwo. Their purpose is to secure their spots and \"hold down talent\". They take on the entire WWE roster. You\\'re not very good at fantasy booking...YOU\\'RE HIRED! \\n\\nReally though, this card barely makes sense and the outcomes scream \"I\\'m from the U.K. So I wanna be there live for these changes.\"  Are you the red headed Australian guy I talked to in the beer line before the show? I guess. At the same time, there\\'s the other stuff I mentioned.\\n\\nAlso, Nakamura is so unique he kind of transcends nationality. He\\'s not Japanese, he simply... Is.\\n\\nAnd also, Nakamura isn\\'t really the kind of individual to point that out to Jinder. More just silently laugh at Jinder then kick his head off. WOOOOOO! Iconic They left a lot of money on the table for international expansion. They didn\\'t even hold a show in Canada until 1999.  He just flair flopped, that\\'s all.  Nah, a fatal four way seems the direction they\\'re going Jinder/shinsuke/rusev/randy With the company going all out on it\\'s \"Social media dominance\" image, Cyber Sunday esque twitter polls would be a pretty good idea. Better than the awkward promos mentioning trends. I\\'m pretty sure they had a strong following in Germany for some time, even at the very end.   Shit, if my momma was a wrestling fan, you best believe I\\'d take her with me to every single show.  Thank the Gods. He looks really weak though.\\n\\nWOOOOOOOO I started watching GFW again like 3 or 4 weeks ago(last time I watched was like early 2016), and its been pretty entertaining, the only outstandingly bad thing is that the commentary team *never* sounds excited.  They get alot more shit than they deserve.  Just miss that fat and oily BIG DICK JOHNSON! Bring em back! But a vast majority are not. Honestly looking back at these things is kind of cringe worthy, it just seemed so fake and try-hard, like Russo WCW  Needs more jpeg GOAT Sad Rich Swann please  Corbin\\'s outburst was seen as a great offense and would have to face Maroon in an Agni Ki. But you see because Corbin had spoken up in Vince\\'s creative meeting, it was Vince that he had offended. Corbin would have to duel his own boss! People say that was his Daniel Bryan moment in UFC, at least Bryan got his face kicked in by distraction.  No, Sasha lost it last week, so we\\'re all good again, now. Sounds like something TNA would do. Thank you ｡&amp;#94;‿&amp;#94;｡ Lee/Dijak vs Riddle/Cobb, Fenix vs Horus, and Ricochet vs Flamita. \\n\\nRicochet and Flamita went on last and did a bunch of amazing shit. There were a few small botched moments but the high spots were insane. Whereas Fenix and Horus didn\\'t have the noticeable mistakes but it wasn\\'t as balls to the wall insane. \\n\\nMy favorite was the tag match though. It\\'s so fun to see Lee and Cobb move the way they do at their size.  man he _looks_ like a guy who just kicked out at 2.9 from a pinfall from death.\\n\\nglad he\\'s alive though. I don\\'t think it was a work, but it did have the reaction kayfabe injuries used to have.\\n\\nTremendous sympathy for the injured.\\n\\nTremendous anger at the injurer. But...but...but PC principal, we\\'re white males, we need to check our privileges first **WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!** He\\'s awesome  Yep, i also miss the run in with no entrance music, playing the music first totally ruins the run in. Based Flair  [OLDEST RIDE LONGEST LINE WOOOOOOOOOOO](https://media.giphy.com/media/ENl0DcjBF2Xio/giphy.gif) If it\\'s anything like Jeremiah Crane\\'s \"around the ring cannonball senton\", I\\'m sold. He fell on his fucking arse! Ain\\'t he great? Z Pak Brand So, who\\'d win in a real fight?  What I have read by him does not come across as someone that specializes in CTE.  Nah, I prefer Mauro in NXT anyways. Super controversial comment /s: I really like Okada.  Yes, toward the end of his book. He says Dillinger would fall asleep in front of the locker room.  I really hope this year marks the end of Sexy Star\\'s career.  Saw him once or twice at Download Festival this year, and while a little green, he still did a fairly decent job. try [mine](https://abload.de/img/ajhbpspbn.jpg) Ouch, purple Psychosis is not a good look. only in germany it was big to the point that there was a ppv in 2000 called millenium final, but the ppv is not on the network Paid a lot less which is the issue... Yeah. David went to All-Japan after his WWE developmental stint was up and after that he stopped wrestling regularly around 05 or so. I don\\'t get the sense they\\'re estranged, just think David is done with the business.  http://i.imgur.com/me1gROp.gif I\\'d agree he\\'s certainly improved since the draft last year but he still has a way ahead of him You\\'d get black out drunk.  because he\\'s always P1 (Player 1) on his Xbox 360 ;-) I think dean and seth losing way before wrestlemania  Breh, that\\'s an awesome composition.\\n\\nI\\'m going to need a clean MP3 version of this ASAP. Where is it? I see no links in the description for a download. We had a German wrestler named Frank Andersson in 94.  He appeared on Worldwide a few times, but nothing of note  I usually avoid these ever since seeing that one video where a fan pushes Eddie off a ladder mid-match. \\n\\nSeeing fans in the ring like this makes me extremely uncomfortable.   I agree! After all, she did kill it portraying the role of [Cow #2](https://instagram.com/p/BYeaUO8jEvJ/). Didn\\'t Marti fail to go over the top rope properly and just flailed during a TNA battle royal once, back when she was part of The Dollhouse with Mia Yim and Taryn Terrell? I\\'m pretty sure no one gives a shit about PW Spyware in the year 2017.  No one has been talking about Taker/No Mercy or PWS. He was tagging with Ibushi on the G1 undercards, and they had a match with ZSJ and Desperado on day two that I remember being really good. And just because they\\'re being used, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s improving anything about the title or Tamina and Lana. \\n\\nTamina and Lana will still suck at the end of the day, and the title scene will still suck if they don\\'t at least use Becky and Charlotte to help push Naomi and Natalya. \\n\\nI know people think it\\'s better that the title scene isn\\'t just a revolving door for Charlotte and Becky, but that\\'s far better than what the WWE is doing otherwise. They don\\'t even need to win the title. Just let them work with Natalya/Naomi and make their main program feel better. \\n\\nAs it stands, they\\'re only keeping Becky and Charlotte from overshadowing the rest of the women while they don\\'t do anything to help them feel important.  10 years later and I am still making The Jiz jokes.. Is that like Bullet Club, but for fish? Bantered himself into a shoot, brother. Fuckin Joe Rogan. Didn\\'t get the joke. Should of made some Shockmaster joke I thought I was safe from seeing a Conte reference in a wrestling sub.  Yeah, it quickly went from: \\n\\n&gt;Rule #1: Always lock your opponent by the waist when attempting a suplex\\n\\nto\\n\\n&gt;EXTREME RULE #12: DON\\'T TAKE A CHAINSAW TO DA BELLY\\n I called her a cunt because she\\'s a cunt. I have no predisposition to call women that exclusively. In fact, I\\'ve probably called more guys cunts in my life than women. Basically, it wasn\\'t misogyny, it was people rightfully going after someone for being a piece of shit. Fuck off Plus considering he had a year with the briefcase for then to get over it.  Yeah, they don\\'t want to be under on takers. Dakota Kai is half Samoan. I loved this, and 04\\'s \"Winner\\'s team takes turns being GM\" and 05\\'s \"Smackdown vs RAW.\" All three ended with Orton as the Sole Survivor as he is commonly known to do. Cool justification.   I always wondered how in the hell he got away with using that name for so long. Especially with the gimmick he had. It\\'s also kind of like doing a screwjob angle in Montreal - oh this shit again? Lol, shit my bad. Got worked by a troll. Later guy And still managed to pull off a 5 star match against Naito. The man is a fucking living legend.  You want some ice cream, Doc? What kind do ya like? Chocolate it is then. I\\'m Latrell Sprewell, I\\'ll choke the coach AND EVERYONE THEY LIKE IS SO TEENY AND TINY OMG.  TIL defending women equals trolling.  Have fun at the Trump rally tonight. I got goosebumps  It\\'s why a lot of people are jumping from UFC to Bellator. In Bellator fighters have control over their sponsors and have a lot more freedom.   This is the match that made me hate Brooklyn... Exactly. I Pedigreed my best mate at High School more times than I can remember. No matter how hard/easy a move is, kids will copy it.  Big fan, keep it going! According to this subreddit, everyone watches it! Lmao fucking idiots.  I was very offended by the title, I clicked in the post and all was well.  Think if this happened on RAW - The camera would cut and the announcers wouldn\\'t even mention it.   Literally voted for Bernie and Hillary. Are you serious lad? Like honestly, is this just like, what you do? Man, he looks rough. But for someone who came damn close to death, he does looks pretty good. Glad he\\'s keeping the spirits up! I can\\'t figure out who will die first between him and Keith Richards. Oh, come on. Don\\'t be that way.  It made me ashamed to have a comment on this sub.  Kavita is obviously green but I think she has loads of potential. Give her time and I think she\\'ll go far. Helps that Dakota Kai made her look like a real threat too.  He\\'s the fucking worst. Saw a video of him at a live event and was so loud and obnoxious would of hated to be sat near him No, that\\'s a stereotype, not racism.  Both Meltzer &amp; other sources reported before the match even started, Marti Belle had a ton of heat from being arrogant and generally rubbing people the wrong way backstage. Originally she was supposed to go over Rachel Evers, but as their match progressed Marti showed that she was nowhere near worth the effort of putting over. Botching just about everything, over-acting; anything and everything went wrong from her perspective. The few times Evers got on a run were the most fluid points in the match.\\n\\nHence the ref got the call mid-match to report a change in the finish. Evers kicked out of Marti\\'s finisher and immediately went for the fruit-roll-up finish. Looked up his Pro MMA record. Very first pro fight was a No Contest due to \"fighters fell through cage door.\" You\\'re getting better, man. Haha. David arquette can i put on my king corbin hat back on now? None of those titles are relevant and like 200,000 people watch their show. I don\\'t know, but I\\'m glad he did. That man is a treasure to humanity. Yes, but I\\'m AJ Styles-sized and just want to go around yelling about how I\\'m the Tag Team Champions. He does have the face of a child... Theory checks out. Kurt was also concussed in one of his previous matches that night. Maybe they think it makes a safe but good visual for it then?  Not sure. r/wwegames IIRC. She was one of the backups incase of an injury happening. Someone got injured and she got put in.  Any proof she uses steroids though? Win royal rumble Tony Schiavone is someone that I never appreciated back in the day (in fact, I hated his commentary), but damn, do I miss him now. Damn can kinda tell what he went through took a lot out of him cause he can\\'t get real emphatic with the WOOO. It\\'s softer and not as sharp. But none the less, WOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! One of the first NXT shows I watched. I fell in love with Graves\\' commentary right away. No for real i dont know bout all this weave stuff. So you said its a wig but how does that work and is her hair real? I am a guy dont expect me to know tis stuff. Genuinely question: Who is he and what makes him special to be a future NJPW \"top star\"? Honestly how do you even take that bump?  She sold it as a \"knock me stiff\" kick , so does she just fall straight back (that\\'s a long way down for a back bump) or does she fall to the side and hit the apron and then the floor?\\n\\nAnyone have a link of someone taking this bump well? I feel like the later half of 2014 was good too, with the survivor series build and Rollins wanting to kill Edge It\\'s just as likely, if not more likely, that Cena is going to be gone for a long time and they\\'re doing this now because they\\'re not sure when else they\\'ll be able to do it. Eh maybe.  2000. The King!! What willll he do hahaah And all of deans look like ass Yeah, it\\'s the whole running around the ring and accelerating that adds to it. I\\'m a little disappointed because I fully expected him to blade and drop a few elbows. Either way, its great seeing him getting better. Ric is dressed like Ellsworth Lite.\\n\\nSeriously though, happy to see him up and moving. The world needs more Naitch. It was his attire in smackdown shut your mouth as well Ospreay\\'s more recent matches are alot better than say a year or two ago. He still does the flippy shit but hes gotten a better understanding of selling, psychology, etc. And hes only 24.(I think)  That was when Tom was on raw as a backstage interviewer though. He was brought to smackdown as an announcer. i can see what he\\'s done for wrestling, and i can also see what he\\'s done to wrestling.\\n\\n My heads fucked up, first thing that came in my head\\n\\n\"He meant take lots of steroids so your heart is enlarged.\" Thanks  Oh... oh god.   Brooklyn* Bluetista That event name is a nice summary of DDT tbh You God damn right! WOOOOOOO! Charlotte is pretty clearly there to be champion at some point, but I guess they realized she\\'d been in the title picture nonstop since back when it was the stupid butterfly belt and decided to cycle her out of there for a bit. I\\'d have to imagine that their team will be in the Dusty Rhodes tag team tournament. Which bald guy do you think is Dana White? You may need glasses. they know who roman reigns is.. Yet He can\\'t help that he\\'s custom made.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/_1LcJ6N9vwo &gt;[**Ric Flair - Custom Made [1:58]**](http://youtu.be/_1LcJ6N9vwo)\\n\\n&gt;&gt;I did not make it.

Cool thanks As a musician I have a bit of a different perspective on this, I think it would be hard for me to stop. I love what I do and it\\'s the very essence of what I feel my life is about. I\\'d definitely think about it, but I can\\'t honestly say that I would stop. You can tell he\\'s lived a crazy ass life. Think of all the crazy shit he did that made you love him, he truly should be on the Mt. Rushmore of wrestling. I remember watching him take off a mask that Hurricane gave to some kid and absolutely losing my shit at how good it was. Just a master heel and entertainer. Amazing charisma, truly one of the best. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO The UFC test didn\\'t clear him. But is she an Anoa\\'i, or is she the women\\'s equivalent of Samoa Joe? Of course they test for RX drugs. They possess similar metabolites to street narcotics. Adderall/meth. Heroin/morphine. Etc  I don\\'t know how to break it to you but the women still wrestle in what is essentially underwear.  Just add ukuleles and kazoos. The venue was hot, but they actually had AC on so it wasn\\'t as bad as it could have been. I think the year Ricochet won was the hottest I have experienced in there You realise that\\'s typically a sign of growth, right?\\n\\nWWE is investing in the American market without changing prices as well. *slaps chest...*\\n*WOOOOOOOO!!!*\\n*rips IVs off...*\\n*slaps chest....*\\n*rips hospital gown off...*\\n*Runs toward wall mimicking hitting the ropes....*\\n*Elbow drops gown*\\n*WOOOOOOOO!!!* Definitely a babyface turn for me.

If this isnt the most upvoted post of all time this subreddit should be shut down. Still, there were so many people in this sub who were upset when she left the WWE. All I could think was, were you guys watching the same product I was? She was never interesting or good in any way. If you were only interested in her looks, good news! She\\'s still modeling/acting. You can still look at her. She just has no place being in a wrestling ring.  I think it was fire anyone over the age 35, and bringing in Daniel Bryan and having him beat everyone on the roster were two of his plans. WOOOOOO! I fucking love the shirt! Flair is genuinely the first man I ever associated \"legend\" with. I remember my first live event was a few months after I started watching in Sydney 04, as a 7 yr old joining in with a crowd of people on the way to the arena screaming WOOOOOOO is still my favourite live experience, so happy he\\'s doing good and doing it with some classic flair The drive-by is not a literal name, and it\\'s not called the drive-by shooting. What Reigns does is a leaping kick to the side of the face, that\\'s not what a drive-by is in real life. The curb stomp that Rollins did was literally what a curb stomp is, jumping on top of someone\\'s head and driving it into the ground. American History X didn\\'t invent the curb stomp, it\\'s the name of a violent act and the violence act is the same as the move. The drive-by is not what a drive-by is, people trying to copy the Roman Reigns drive-by are not going to shoot people, are they? As I said earlier, don\\'t be so fucking dense. I think you mean he\\'s AAAAWWWWWSSSSOOMMEE! Haha what. It was a planned spot that didn\\'t go to plan. I don\\'t think it\\'s been confirmed anywhere but I think Lesnar didn\\'t hit hard enough on the first shot and over compensated on the second to make sure he didn\\'t have to do a third and fucked Randy up.  And then you realize both women in the video died young... :( Smackdown where we got Shinsuke vs Cena was good  I don\\'t want them to break up before Wrestlemania 34 Miz\\'s success story is one of my favorite. He worked his ass off for everything and he fucking earned everything he\\'s done! Noam\\'s the linguistics teacher you non-UK lot need.  I want them to stay together and eventually being reigns back to the group  &gt; fire anyone over the age 35,\\n\\nmeanwhile, in NXT.... In the world of backstabbing, they\\'re punishing a guy for burying someone to his face, in a room full of witnesses?  That\\'s weird.  \\n\\nThe Wellness Policy is and always has been a media tool and nothing more.  They don\\'t give a shit about the wrestlers health. The Archduke of Abs He is the greatest man who ever lived. This is *amazing*! Would he be back from injury by then? False. I do not miss him.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhsEep3KVHo The post that almost ended my subscription to this sub. \\n\\n💩💩💩 I could give a shit about Ambrose, but Rollins got me back into wrestling after like a 15 year hiatus.  I missed all the shield stuff too, but I loved the guy was so athletic and could do AND REVERSE about every move in the book.  First RAW I came back to he came out and gave an open challenge and Neville came out and almost took his belt.  I was really impressed and though \"OH SHIT WRESTLING IS LIT NOW\", but I really just wanted to see him peform.  It was really refreshing to see a character/athlete like that (and you can tell that crossfit has a huge part in that).  Not only that, but his mic work was great.  I  bought the first piece of wrestling merch I owned in the \"Never shuts up\" tshirt (mocking Cena after breaking his nose.)  Stealing the belt at WM  and then Winning the US title to hold 2 belts.\\n\\nSo in reality, I came back to watch a super-athletic guy which I liked at the peak of his metoric rise and the only thing that stopped it was injuries.  If they brought him back as a face, they could have had a face that could have carried the company for years (IMO), but they kind of botched his return.\\n\\nDean for me has the complexity and moveset of a wet cardboard box. I don\\'t get excited watching him like I do for Rollins and to a lesser extent, KO. Very true, I just hoped that with it being KLR\\'s second shot at the WWE, we\\'d get something a bit more substantial . There is no TNA what’s with the influx of new shitty accounts? Definitely see him at least being Jr Heavyweight champ one day.  I\\'m so happy he\\'s still wih us. Woooo! He has said on Talk is Jericho that even with all their anger, it was comforting to know that when that leg drop was coming down, it was Matt Hardy on the other hand (this was for his ~~ladder match~~ edit: cage match). But he did say that in their first match, he was okay with Matt laying it in a little bit (something along the lines of \"I get it.\") So logic would indicate that Goldust\\'s exaggerated height makes up the difference.  Low Ki, Psicosis, AJ Styles, and Jerry Lynn in the first-ever TNA X Division Championship match. AJ basically worked the whole match on one foot because the other one was in an iron boot. What u mean i have 3 accounts  Are you being serious... thank u This also would let him flex his comedic chops in a better setting than promos. \"FUCK JBL HE\\'S A BULLY. LETS ALL GANG UP ON EVERYONE WHO LIKED HIS WORK AND THINK HE DESERVES CREDIT FOR DOING A NICE THING BECAUSE IT\\'S ALL FOR A PR STUNT.

Not my guy Jon Jones he is clean its just that he keeps getting set up by the man Yeah the auto-translate told me as much lol Since it goes back to 20 years we\\'re probably gonna have a RAW is WAR theme next time I will never retire (from life)! Because for a lot of that time, he booked himself. I\\'m waiting on seeing what they do with Kane, surely they\\'d make an exception Other videos in this thread:\\n\\n[Watch Playlist &amp;#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r6xm9le?feature=playlist&amp;nline=1)\\n\\nVIDEO|COMMENT\\n-|-\\n[Tom Lawlors Hulk Hogan entrance at UFC Fight Night against Aaron Simpson](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3dv93j)|[+114](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6xm9le/_/dmgzyrg?context=10#dmgzyrg) - Here he is doing Hulk Hogan\\'s entrance:\\n[Tom Lawlor - Weigh in - UFC 113](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uvvFv1HEIk)|[+16](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6xm9le/_/dmh24vh?context=10#dmh24vh) - here he is doing dan severn\\n[The Shockmaster (Higher Quality)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_tbsf2PPzk)|[+3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6xm9le/_/dmh6hm3?context=10#dmh6hm3) - That Shockmaster Promo is just so so bad.

CMLL has operated 84 years without English commentary. I\\'d like it if they did, but they are very traditional as a company and I don\\'t think they really have expanding into the US Market as a goal.  I\\'ve already countered your point. Also CM Punk was a holier-than-thou pompous asshole HEEL. Austin, The Rock, and Hulk Hogan have all been boo\\'d in their prime. It\\'s called being a proper heel. I\\'m sorry that this needed to be explained to you.\\n\\nPerhaps one day you\\'ll learn to have a civilized conversation and not resort to childish name-calling as if we\\'re still in kindergarten. \\n\\n For more info check out his [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Youngblood).\\n\\n* [Jay Youngblood vs. Dory Funk, Jr. - Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling: October 13, 1982](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1QBsS9O_f4) Meltzer better give him 5* after all those false finishes.  If you want to keep the cadence of the original saying it would be \\n\\n\"What doesn\\'t kill you gets you over\". Which actually works when you look at how popular wrestlers are when they make a come back from injury Hopefully we\\'ll see a lot more stuff like that on the main roster when Hunter takes the reigns, I always liked seeing stuff outside of the PC like Hideo Itami getting injured before the triple threat with Balor and Tyler Breeze or that security camera footage of the Revival attacking Enzo and Cass before their tag title match. He\\'s played an invisible man for most of his career. Based.. Yes But this time they\\'re actually going to die hahahaha Summerslam 97, Stone Cold Vs Owen Hart. Good idea. Lets me know that if he tweets in the following days after Minoru Suzuki attacks him, that he is still alive Daniel Bryan finally snaps from all the pressures of being GM and starts yelling \"No!\" instead of \"Yes!\" again. He really did lose his smile! It really bums me out the Sid doesn\\'t like Yakimori.  Dakota Kai is the total package. She got the potential to be a huge star, and I hope she will be used the way to be one. Becky makes it work. The other two...do not. He just near died of course he looks weak, goes without saying BIG MIKE IS FOLLOWING ME ON TWITTER! *SWOON* Give each show its own personality again, do something so that each respective brand division stands out a bit not just split them down the middle and have them be almost carbon copies of each other with simply different wrestlers.\\n\\n1) Radically, I\\'d change one of the brand\\'s tag titles to a 6 man / Trios Open style tag title. \\n\\nThis will give all the existent or possible factions (Shield, Miz with Miz-tourage, New Day, Wyatts, Sanity, Jinder &amp; Singh Brothers, The Club) something to fight for and leave the tag specialists (Revival, Ascension, Hype Bros, etc) to do their own thing without a hanger on standing at ringside.\\n\\nIt\\'d give it a faster pace and can lead to a combination of different matches; singles, straight tag and the 6 man and lead to some interesting combinations. Lucha Underground has proven this format works.\\n\\n2) Split the Womens division between those on Total Divas and those who aren\\'t. By having all the Total Divas on one show it\\'ll help closer continuity between the shows and means that all the talent on Total Divas are on the same travel / filming schedule\\n\\n3) Reduce the amount of writers and lean more on the experience of the road agents when it comes to booking. Follow the lead of NXT where sometimes less is more. The two main shows seem to have too many cooks in the kitchen.\\n adding -eth to a word makes it sound like old English so it\\'s done to be funny 1) Make the product a hybrid of your typical TV show, Lucha Underground and WWE. None of the supernatural stuff, but make some of the episodes away from the arenas except for backstage segments and jobber matches (which can be done at the live events)..show what the character\\'s lives are like away from the ring, establish characters, friendships, feuds, storylines, etc etc. Use the weekly TV shows to build PPV matches and what not.\\n\\n\\n2) Don\\'t make the babyfaces look like dumbasses. Its important to get heat on the heels obviously but in the end the heels need to get their comeuppance with a babyface victory.\\n\\n\\n3) Let the announcers and wrestlers do their thing. Give bulletin points on what needs to be said or done, but let them bring their own touch to the table instead of micromanaging them and making the product formulaic.  So we\\'re saying the only way the usos will avoid being put on the pre show at wrestlemania as champs, is if they face each other? And yes, that\\'s Rollins\\' first singles minitron  it would be six stars if he was in japan... That sounded like Larry Zbyszko to me Yes I would expect nothing less from Ric Flair announcing he\\'s alive and well. It wasn\\'t the final blow. But it was when the cracks started to show.  Used to appear at 7 o\\'clock Friday night after Cartoon Network stopped broadcasting on its shared station with TNT. It had moderate success if I recall correctly. WCW tapes were quite easy to find in video rental shops too.  I wonder if chioda asked him after every kick DO YOU WANT TO QUIT They show videos, usually do a video question game with one of the announcers and a fan, other than that nothing.  *Chris Conte* \\n\\nFuck that guy. Still pisses me off from the Green Bay game where all you had to do was not let them score a touchdown on the last play and we\\'d be in the playoffs. A Rodgers 40 yard pass later and they\\'re heading to the playoffs. Thanks Chris, everyone hates you.  Does it hit a little too close to home? Reminds you of yourself too much? I\\'m loving Elias right now he\\'s competent in the ring, has a really diverse moveset (still waiting on that smooth elbow drop tho) and is a heat magnet. Guitar shot can also be a good super-finisher when he gets that main event push in 2 years or so I think Dolph Ziggler would be a great candidate to host a SUPERKICK PARTY GTV lives on..... I think after the comparassion betwen the Rock and el Santo it\\'s clear to me that you don\\'t understand the level of cultural icons that El Santo and Demon are in Mexico,  my whole life I have never know someone that doesn\\'t know who el Santo and Deamon are here in my country, but outside of wrestling sites I have only know 3 people that like Lucha Libre aside for me, here you not only have el Santo/Deamon movies every weekend on TV, this two have expositions in museums dedicated to them, you have stores in the country in where you can buy nothing but things related to el santo or blue demon, to this day people still make movies and tv series about them, you have books that tal about mexican history that have chapter dedicated to talk about El Santo and Blu Deamon, you have statues aroun Mexico city that have them, you have monuments, streets, dedicated to them, this guys are not icons this guys are gods. \\n\\nIf I went to the USA and decided to publicy talk shit about the rock, I would make some people mad for sure and be seen as an ass, but if I as a Mexican decided to talk shit about el Santo, I would be seen as someone who disrespects his own culture.\\n\\nAs much as I love Atlantis (My favorite wrestler of all time by far), he was \"the guy\" in two eras in where Lucha Libre decressed his popularity, that\\'s why most people in my country don\\'t even know who Atlantis is, for me he is the best in ring worker thta I\\'ve ever seen, but in wrestling you need more than that to be the greatest of all time, Atlantis didn\\' change anything about Lucha Libre, El Santo did, Blue Demon did, Mil did, Dos Caras did, El Perro Aguayo did,  you are one of the greates of all time when it\\'s almost close to imposible to find a match with you on it, but still be synonymous with your sport. honestly for me, what stands out is his character work, he plays being a little dickhead really well, always a sore loser, always bites off more than he can chew, i love to hate him.  My reaction too.\\n\\n*sigh* \"figures.\" Overall idk. I\\'d say raw and SD after mania were pretty loaded. Other than that idk what full episode I saw and went dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmn Skip RAW and SDL if you find yourself short on time. The matches and stories of the MYC are way better. damn it should have added tv show, oh well gonna accept my downvotes with grace.  The ratings were actually really low, however the advertising was lucrative as it was believed people who watch the dog show are wealthy people who will happily part with their money, unlike us broke ass wrestling fans Holy actual shit you\\'re acting like he killed a child. \\n\\nEveryone reading this right now has done something just as bad or worse than what he did. He was mean to a coworker and showed a lack of empathy. If you\\'re going to tell me you\\'ve never been mean to a classmate or coworker, or that you\\'ve never displayed a lack of empathy, you\\'re lying. The difference is he tries to make himself feel better about his wrongdoings by helping others, while most people make themselves feel better by harshly judging everyone else\\'s wrongdoings. Because slapnuts How about Juvie?\\n\\nOr the episode where Kevin Nash made shoot commentary all night? &gt; Also CM Punk was a holier-than-thou pompous asshole HEEL.\\n\\nIn early 2009 he was a babyface...........dumbass Per WrestleZone:\\n\\n\"GFW has been slowly promoting their new\\xa0over-the-top streaming service called the Global Wrestling Network, and we know now the service will be available this September.\\n\\nJosh Mathews and Jeremy Borash hyped the OTT service during tonight’s episode of Impact Wrestling, confirming the September launch as well as it being available on iOS, Android and a new website called GlobalWrestlingNetwork.com\" Is it bad that I thought this was a link to a creepy Charlotte Flair fansite? I\\'m probably (most likely) just retarded as hell, but I can\\'t hear the HBK song out of this at all Ciampa teams up with Kevin Owen\\'s and faces a baby face team of zayn and gargano for the tag titles...\\n\\nOn the pre-show of Roadblock 3. Isn\\'t Shawn a trainer now? Probably in town anyway.  He looks rough. But glad to have the nature boy back WOOOOO He\\'s a lot like Minoru, legit shoot background, but knows not to take himself too seriously.  Choose Life Does he still have a podcast? I remember my cousin dying from cancer a few years back, and to this day, I don\\'t think my aunt and uncle have ever been the same, nor will ever be the same. I\\'ve read in different places that life doesn\\'t get better ever again, you just simply have new normals. You will never be as happy as you were prior to that, and I kinda wish WWE were more sensitive to that, with the video game panel and even the angle with Paige were incredibly bad, especially when you read up on Flair\\'s feelings of the whole situation.\\n\\nTo try and go off into another topic without a good way to segway, I\\'d be interested in stories on Bram and Charlotte\\'s relationship wit him. He doesn\\'t seem as extreme or messed up as her first husband, but Bram certainly is a story all to himself. From getting fired from WWE for his battery charge, to his domestic abuse allegations against his girlfriend (not Charlotte) and his recent issues in NOAH, that man is a walking train wreck.  The 3 years of MMA training makes a difference on someone who doesnt have any experience.  AJ Styles I think you\\'re actually mentally ill. A curb stomp is the act of jumping on someone\\'s head and driving it into the ground. That is exactly what Seth Rollins\\' finisher was. A drive-by shooting is the act of driving a car past someone while shooting at them. The drive-by that Roman Reigns does is a leaping kick to the side of the head. If you can\\'t understand the very obvious difference, you are mentally deficient. Now fuck off. Charles Robinson started off as a ring photographer before turning into a ref.\\n\\nHe has always permed his hair to look like ric from like age 5.\\n\\nSeriously listen to the talk is Jericho episode. It\\'s amazing.  http://33.media.tumblr.com/229ec0458891c4dcd847545c81e760a5/tumblr_mpfy232F4j1rxrpjzo1_r2_500.gif [Superstar Ink with Goldy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ae-qmHKuSk) Flair had a match with God, then low blowed God and ran away, what a heel  Wat Accident report going off on Roman having a picture of himself on his gear was great He\\'s maybe my favorite talker in wrestling today Had you stated it like \"in my opinion\" at any point in your comment instead of stating it like facts it\\'d be better. No need to use such a derogatory term you child. \"The Big Dawg\" reference is from the youtube/streamer group newLEGACYinc. They play a lot of wrestling games and have been joined by wrestlers such as Andrew Everett, Jervis Cottonbelly, Player Uno, Rosemary, and Dakota Kai. They refer to their guests as \"Big Dawgs\". Oh please. Jarrett was doing a pyramid scheme on buying his \"gold\". Hes everything in the book. Imagine how sad you must be to spend Saturday calling out people on a Wrestling Forum next time: with  All the people on Old school Raw got too old to work. Even the wrestlers from the Attitude Era are approaching their 50s.\\n After 4 wives Flair most definitely isn\\'t a multi-millionaire  Filthy 4 Daily with Bryan Alvarez I\\'m gonna sign up for sure. This should be awesome and something they really needed. Bold to call someone a fuck boy when you are using a throw away alt  Kris wolf VS Alexa bliss.\\n\\nKris wold Vs everyone.  Orange County myself! Foreign faces sometimes get the \"i like America\" treatment. Santino did when he was introduced, Vladimir Kozlov did when he turned face (which coincided with his IRL citizenship being granted, which WWE used as part of the turn)... It just doesn\\'t happen very often.\\n\\nI actually really liked (heel) U.S. Champ Cesaro\\'s run, which was less \"fuck America\" and more \"WTF America, I\\'m better at your values than you are\" pointing out a lot of the hypocrisy in U.S. culture. Newsflash ....we\\'re all marks, numbnuts  Not sure what they\\'ll be able to offer besides old TNA stuff. Maybe get AAA/NOAH/Crash stuff up as well? Going to be really interesting to see what they\\'ll be able to put up and at what price point WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  I hope they put new episodes on it weekly This was the first live show I attended. I was 8 years old and very confused by this match.  Reality shows are incredibly cheap to make. It\\'s almost impossible for a successful reality show (and TD ratings were good by reality standards) to not make money. As for TNA it\\'s a much more expensive show to make. Dijak looked like he was having the time of his life. I\\'m sad this will be his only PWG show, if all accounts are true, but he\\'s making the most out of it. As an American, let me tell you, it\\'s a nightmare. You need a good full-time job that offers good healthcare insurance. And even then, you\\'re not always guaranteed full coverage.\\n\\nYou need to hope against hope that nothing bad happens to you or your family. Like, if you have cancer or need multiple major surgeries... rip. Your wallet is going to get annihilated.\\n\\nAnd if you\\'re poor or have no health insurance, just forget about it. The manager didn\\'t sell that headbutt at all.  And a remarkably extravagant lifestyle  Wooooooooooooo &gt; just faded away....\\n\\nAnd classified himself as obsolete? Ric Flair\\'s creditors won\\'t let him die.  It\\'s fascinating and worrying at the same time. I genuinely don\\'t understand how such a simple concept can be so confusing.  ...\\n\\nGuess it\\'s back to whiskey for me. I wonder if he\\'d let Taker break that policy?  Multi man matches, I guess? I don\\'t think they\\'re available online within the game yet. Wish it could\\'ve happen around the same time WWE Network launched  Hey now, The Swagger Soaring Eagle was GOAT. I remember starting to buy RF video because a friend had a tape and the preview had Muta vs Jinsei  Thank god I read so much Irving Welsh growing up. I totally got all that. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s an incredible song and the most fitting song for Jericho to ever come out to, but what the hell are some of these lyrics?  Also if we count NXT that was the year the NXT live specials started and the year the WWE Network launched. http://grantland.com/features/the-wrestler-real-life/\\n\\nRic was basically broke a few years ago from wasting all his money and spending too much (and his divorces), so I\\'m sure he doesn\\'t have a ton of money socked away now. Bessie... and her tits! I like this repackage. If being in SDL de-facto main event is heat then... I dunno. Also of he does have heat because he was shitting on a CTE denier, then good on him. I guess we\\'ll finally get to see all of those GFW episodes Jeff taped like 2 years ago.  Sami Zayn vs John Cena. This is probably the biggest match he had in the wwe. They don\\'t they just rename the curb stomp. Hell, his old finish was the Avada Kedavra in FCW, just rename it that. Of all the finishes in WWE banned for being too dangerous, that is the silliest one. I\\'m sure it\\'s probably easier and safer to pull off then the V-Trigger/Rainmaker combo as that has potential to go wrong.  IG and fitness model\\'s get endorsement too, Eva was in WWE for 4 years and her net worth is 2 million so she accomplished what she set out to do, without actually being a good wrestler\\n\\nSad part is I could see the E channel giving her, her own reality TV show   You are getting worked, mark. Lol you\\'re so edgy aren\\'t you. Personally insulting me for 0 reason at all yet chastising JBL for being a bully. The irony. One of the things I LOVE about Lucha Underground are how all the non-wrestling segments all follow the medium of television and are edited super nicely His podcast is one of my favorites and Tony seems to be a good guy. Now that Klondike Bill on the other hand... thats dope. its extra as fuck, but definitely dope Yes Love everything about this.\\n\\nThe fact that he\\'s back to his old self, the fact he can still cut a promo, and the fact he has this new (and ridiculous) merch.\\n\\nGod bless this man. Just when I thought they had their shit together  No, they only stopped having Tom do 205 Live about 2 months ago, long after he had been on SDL exclusively as a commentator.  He sold at least one shirt from this.  Sure. That\\'s all well and good. And I can\\'t wait for him to win the belt and hopefully fight AJ at Mania. Doesn\\'t change the fact that I\\'d love to see him in NJPW sooner than later.  Tony Schiavon... Sorry we\\'re out of time. WOOOOO!!!!! Those definitely look like McDonalds buns. I\\'d wager the TNA Backlog, plus the backlogs of all their partners. And the like...3(?) shows GFW ran He\\'s gonna walk the aisle, right out of that hospital ward and back home. New series gives me time to get my own series set up!\\n\\nGonna love this you got going. And I have a feeling 90% will be WCW cause they thrived off the fans interfering. Peak Lashley looks like he was made out of balloons. Jacked beyond belief. Jeezus.  &gt; His current gimmick is awful, but idiots eat up worked shoots. \\n\\nYeah, dumbasses, stop getting invested in wrestling! Wrestling is for whining on forums, not for getting excited about storylines! nah, everything mixed together it added to the moment. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not something that should happen but it did. It gave it  a \"anything can happen on live TV\" feel and then the ref taking the guy down and intelligent commentators with great calls \"The smallest ref we got took him out, what a tough guy haha\"\\n\\nThat\\'s good tv\\n\\nI would take take that over a camera cut and \"Something something MAGGLE!\" Did Russo and  Hogan/Bishoff  have more control than she was willing to give Heyman.?  Not AJ Styles, but I always thought [this](https://m.imgur.com/FHiuPwR) was pretty solid &gt; Was there no schedule for a show when you got to the town? Do wrestlers sign a sheet to sign up for a promo slot like karaoke?? It\\'s just a fucking mess\\n\\nHad a genuine laugh at that comment Has he made a relation to jerry the king lawler joke yet?\\n\\nHe should have jerry accompany him on an entrance. Also Roman vs Sheamus on the first Raw of 2016 was pretty good in my opinion. Yeah, that makes sense. I forgot about that \\n Good bot Heath Slater marked out **WOOOOO!!** He was Damien Mizdow before Mizdow was cool, lol *blades* The most heartbreaking are the recent videos of Bobby Heenan. His voice was everything, and now, because of throat cancer, he can\\'t speak (although if you listen closely enough, you can kinda tell what he\\'s saying). Despite that, he still has his sense of humor, and he can manage to joke around.  Yeah, I would say i\\'m surprised, but this is TNA. [Gfycat Mirror](https://gfycat.com/LimpingVictoriousLeonberger)  You have to wonder what his plan was. Was he coming in to help Malenko or Psychosis or to just raise some hell and lay them both out.\\nsadly we\\'ll never know... Aside from like, one Dutch Mantell tweet, GFW was very silent on the matter and only talked about it when asked in Interviews. The only other time they talked about it without being asked was releasing that whole contract shit. Do I think they answered too many questions about it? Yeah, they should have calmed down on answering on them. But they never went on random tangents about it like Reby and Matt do. \\n\\n The only mother fucker here is Ric, who has been with all of our mothers, daughters and sisters.  Eden/Brandi Rhodes Do this and put Nigel with Cole and Byron on Raw.  Cole sounded like he was having the time of his life at the UK special. I thought it was Ricky Morton It was a moment sure. But not giving it any attention is the best way to not let other idiots think it\\'s ok to have their \"moment\" as well. \\n\\nCut away. Don\\'t give them their sorely needed attention. Other idiots who may have been thinking of doing the same can see that it\\'s not worth it to be cut away from, ass kicked by security and banned from future events.  yes i remember that it was great. I re watched judgement day 2003 and they had segments of Stone cold forcing bishoff to drink it just added to the dynamics of the two as co-managers.  Hey Fezzik you did something right Is it strange i understood it as an indian? The rat bit was the bit which confused me, thought he was talking about Mickey. He gave the guy a swift kick in the face when the ref held him down. Roman\\'s territory is his yard, Paige\\'s territory is her house, and so on. How was that a stupid idea? Im not sure how much control they had but yeah they had some control As should we all. The guy who worked through a staph infection and gave his absolute all until the end of his contract?  Because if you didn\\'t watch the show in question immediately you\\'re a fucking loser... /s Devi has the physical abilities for this but man, she needs like a year or two to look like she\\'s natural in the ring. Well, to be fair, even in a Kayfabe sense these guys are on complete opposite ends of the personality spectrum. Watch Flair\\'s promos from the mid 80\\'s. The ones cut in the studio in front of that blue background. Very Eli Drake.  SvR 2011 might be my favorite SVR game. I love that game. Enzo using Soul Food? It looks like he\\'s going for a Black Ranger/Conan the Barbarian fusion with the axe. I think I\\'m sad\\n\\nI know I\\'m depressed \\n\\nI take some pills, to make me feel better\\n\\nBut they don\\'t work, they make it worse\\n\\nI think it\\'s time, to end my life\\n\\nI\\'m just a waste of space (waste of space)\\n\\nIm not really ok (really ok)\\n\\nI\\'m just a waste of space (waste of space)\\n\\nI\\'m not ok (ok) CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD! I\\'M ALREADY OVERDRAWN! WOOOOOO! Dude I went into the thread on /r/Movies tos see people\\'s reactions to the new Wasp suit and walked into GOTG2 spoilers\\n They\\'re chanting \\'Sweet\\'. As in 2 Sweet 1, 2 sweet. \"Sweet\"\\n\\nTwo Sweet 1...2...Sweeeeet\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6vg7uv/why_is_the_crowd_yelling_heeeey_after_every_2/ And then Sting would go on to wrestle in a T-Shirt in TNA They are scumbag carnies. And GFW have acknowledged it quite a bit. Seems like something Jarrett and Vampiro may try to capitalize on. She\\'s an actress, playing a character on TV?\\n\\n2001 Steph playing damsel to HHH is not the same character as 2017 Steph that emasculates the men on Raw. Vince did it. #WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Since you are obviously an impassioned Hardy fan and there is going to be zero ground gained on either side of this argument on the Hardy front let\\'s just look at the streaming service alone. \\n\\nHypothetically Anthem takes over in March-ish and announces the network. People would do nothing but bitch for 7 months asking where it was, why isn\\'t it sooner, and lol GFW the entire fucking time. It\\'s a better decision to wait and announce it when it\\'s almost done because for all we know they could have planned to have it out by May but hit production issues and had to post pone it which all the while fans would have been pissed and with every delay you loose more and more hype and more and more people willing to subscribe.  They way I heard the story was, They\\'d get Bryan and a big mean Goldberg type guy. Both guys would squash the whole roster in 2 minute matches for about 8 months. Then, Bryan would squash the big mean guy and make him tap in 30 seconds. During these 8 months Kurt would have been off TV. Then Bryan would cut a promo saying, \"I\\'ve made everyone in TNA tap out\". Then Kurt would come out say \"You haven\\'t made me tap\".   \\n\\nIt\\'s stupid because you would have 2 guys squash your whole roster. Then one of them bury the other just to do a Bryan vs Angle match. What do you do with your roster after that? You would have spent 8 months telling the people that everyone on this roster sucks except Daniel Bryan. That includes AJ, Daniels, Joe, the entire X-Division etc. You could do a great build to Bryan vs Angle without having 2 guys squash the entire roster.  Shawn Michaels Necesito mas articulos! Y\\'all like that? Yeah they should stop ringing the bell after matches too. In fact all wrestling should be done in silence Most fans don\\'t care really care about the safety of the workers. It\\'s also still a body breaking industry even if you tone it down.\\n\\nMost workers drink beer or do drugs to reduce back pain. It\\'s even worse now on the back. At least they\\'re not head drop happy like Noah was in the early days. Fuck off commie He\\'s gonna out live us all Name one better... I\\'ll wait... maybe I\\'m biased but IMO this is the GOAT Female heel run But that was in WWE, a billion dollar company with a brand that was already a household name.  He wouldn\\'t have had that in TNA. Do you have any examples of it? Because genuinely, all I remember is them mainly talking about it in interviews when they were asked about it.  Such vitriol and anger that you are expressing to a complete stranger.  And yes your language is straight misogyny.  You might consider your language and tone and not be so damn ugly and offensive.  Bret Hart vs Razor Ramon and Bret Hart vs Mr. Perfect came to mind. Matches were so good even though neither Razor or Perfect were fully fit. Hi Lance TIL Dale Earnhardt Jr is a wrestling fan yet another becky lynch pervert Does he always say before every match \"I wont lose via a Boston Crab\" and when it happens always he says \"Sorry, next time\"? One could probably write an entire series of books on the levels of mismanagement in WCW. To think they almost were able to topple WWF for a few years back then. And then they just blew it all up from within. He didnt have it with a regional Eastern Championship Wrestling either but turned into the number 3.  Are we really arguing Heyman\\'s mind for the wrestling business? In the UK WWF(E) had a long term exclusivity deal with Sky which excluded any other wrestling TV being broadcast on their networks.\\n\\nHowever, WCW bounced between Channel 5 and regional ITV stations for a while.\\n\\nBack before digital TV, ITV was broadcast from regional broadcast towers, which meant that each region controlled a percentage of the content alongside the nationally broadcast content (actually still the case on Sky, but most people just watch the main national ITV broadcast).\\n\\nAlso, Channel 5 was in its infancy and a large portion of the UK actually couldn\\'t receive the Channel 5 signal! Again, analogue TV signals were broadcast from regional TV antennae and if you didn\\'t have a suitable TV aerial and (usually) direct line of sight to the broadcast tower, chances are you couldn\\'t pick up Channel 5 reliably. It certainly didn\\'t have full UK coverage until it moved to digital broadcasts.\\n\\nSo, WCW never really found a way to hit the entire UK audience, whereas Sky was gaining in popularity and could hit all of the UK - of course, Sky wasn\\'t in as many households then as it is now, but if you had Sky you could watch WWF(E) content wherever you were in the UK.\\n\\nFor those who loved wrestling and could watch WCW, it was certainly relevant. However, due to both WCW and WWF(E) being broadcast from delayed tape (ie not live) and on different days/times, we never really had anything really resembling the Monday Night Wars.\\n Ric Flair\\'s life is just like his Royal Rumble performance.  He just won\\'t let anyone or anything eliminate him. Wooooo! What exactly is this store? I\\'d go there and find out myself but if it\\'s called \"Piledriver\", plus Suzuki is running it, I don\\'t wanna gamble with my life tbh. All the comments were talking about Kavita though, from Indians and Non-Indians alike. Tna is just \"worst of WWE\" I don\\'t even wanna watch this... this shit sounds absolutely crazy\\n\\nEdit: I got downvoted but i meant that in the good wrestling way... I\\'m just kinda of a pussy to this type of shit, like hardway bleeding and shit, i just feel like they\\'re not in safety as much as if they were in a big company doing stunts. Just my opinion didn\\'t wanna come off like a hater Good bot Agreed. I was at that SD so I\\'m a little biased though. Naw man Heyman is GOAT. You would think hed be good with finances since hes jewish but hes good at manipulating. One of the greatest workers of all time ngl tbqh Everyone knows what ever country you\\'re from rocks, and everyone else can suck a dick. It\\'s how everyone feels. Woooo! Ha  Junior Perfection &amp; Junior Schyster  Yeah I\\'m glad you got some of the backstory with Gedo, cause I just realised had some typos in there. I\\'m pretty New Japan doesn\\'t grant people opportunities that earily and Okada was like every other wrestler in the New Japan Dojo and wasn\\'t privileged from the start. Yeah, Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich are clearly the greatest directors in Hollywood and we must like them because they\\'re making MONEY! Your logic right now Big Banter! \\n\\nI\\'m on Baron\\'s side in this. \\n\\n I think it was the TNAVault....if I remember correctly. Why the fuck would you become a wrestler if you don\\'t give a shit about entertaining people? I stopped at \"something, something, something, new jack\" They probably like making money.  I don\\'t know if you have a basic grasp of how life works. Because other countries really are like that. Theres a reason Americans take pride in being American. Most other countries are pieces of shit,and far beyond the type of fucked up we are. Never have a worked for a foreigner,and them not be a shady piece of shit.................. Lol I guess it makes it more \"real\" to see them in immediate danger.  You don\\'t know too much about economics, do ya?

Had nothing to do with talking to Vince about his character, and now he\\'s back and not being punished at all. \\n\\nSandow wasn\\'t let go for talking to Vince, he was just let go like everyone else who gets let go every year. \\n\\nAnd Cody? Cody asked for his release. Cody was being heavily featured up until his departure. He wasn\\'t punished for talking to Vince. Vince just didn\\'t agree with him and went with his own plan instead. That also happened to Stone Cold, Rock, Triple H, STEPHANIE MCMAHON. \\n\\nJust because you open up a relationship with Vince doesn\\'t mean he\\'s always going to listen. He didn\\'t always listen when he was going out of business against WCW and he didn\\'t listen when he was going out of business before WM1. Competition has nothing to do with it really.  Tradition and older workers in the back used to crap on joshi. savage! Because getting over with the audience is how you get up the card. Probably not. He\\'ll keep putting people over and then move to standup. But was he number 3 by default or did he actually achieve that spot? I mean who did he take the number 3 spot from?\\n\\nI don\\'t argue his creativity but I think it\\'s overblown. He ran 1 promotion that had some popularity but it went out of business.  For all their faults, ROH and TNA have had more success than ECW did on it\\'s own. If it wasn\\'t for WWE helping them out, they wouldn\\'t have lasted as long as they did. ...They were still asked the question. And they have done interviews with places such as Sports Illustrated. As far as I know, they don\\'t own SI. There have been various other places that have asked Ed Nordholm and Jeff Jarrett the same question that aren\\'t associated with Anthem in any shape or form. You\\'re reaching for the stars right now.  ---&gt; r/wrasslin Big deal, Flair has been going over Death since Death\\'s old gimmick Anubis Delighted to find there are more of us out there, I dig Bahh immensely.  You can watchmore than 5 actually is hard to find, but you can find the easly on tepito in DVD. But I agree with your point, I disagree with you comparing them with  Georg Hackenschmidt or Buddy Roers, because that would be a misunderstaning of the level of mainstream popularity that El Santo or Blue Demon had, it was so big tha they are still a relevant topic in mexico to this day. \\n\\nAnd Rey it\\'s not a big name in Mexico because of the WWE, Rey it\\'s a big name because he almost singlehandly changed the style of luchalibre in the country, the pereption of Lucha Libre went for matches with  lots of skill and technique to a showcase of highflying maneuvers, and his matches with Psicosis had more to do with it than his WWE career, that siad, you can\\'t eliminate the luchador with most succes in the most succes in a foreign country, specially when that foreign country has the biggest wrestling companny of all time and when said luchador had a size that make him eligible to be  a mini luchador, the career of this guy is enjoyable because of what he was able to accomplish despite of his size in the companny in where he was less likely to do so, this is a far more interesting career that the one of Wagner Jr. in my opinion.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not a fan of ither Demon Jr. or even El Hijo del Santo, but if you think of Blue as a luchador coasting on the name brand of his father, you need to watch more Lucha, because I have seen far worse cases, wich is more this guy even fought against the creation of projects that could\\'ve make hi money but that at the same time could damage the name of his father. \\n\\nBut since you are saying that Wagner is a tops 5 in regards of having a career you can go back and enjoy, let\\'s change the topic to that.\\n\\nEl Hijo del Santo, Octagon, Villano III (the one that had the match with Panther was Villano V by the way), Negro Casas (wich you forgot), Atlantis, Blue Panther, El Dandy, Rey and LA Park, all had far better matches than Dr. Wagner jr. ever had, he was never a outstanding wrestler he got big because of his character and charisma, and even in that regard Negro casas eats him alive. And of them EHS, Blue Panther, Atlantis, Octagon, Villano III, LA Park, Negro Casas and Rey had careers that you can go back and enjoy more, because, like I said with Rey the personal story is better, the path that their careers took is more interesting and of course, the matches are far better, having a long career does not always make it better, specially when is clear that you din\\'t have the level required to be at the top. \\n\\nAnd don\\'t worry I know you are not making an offense, my list was a bout who was the bigger name your list is about who had the best workrate and interesting career, it\\'s different, don\\'t worry, and to be fair Lucha is a different beast than wrestling or puroresu, since the six guys that I mentioned are venerated as some kind of national heroes (like I said Rey is close to that level, the story of a mexican guy that find succes in the biggest companny of the USA is going to feel relatable to lots of people here that want to cross the border,  and if you take in count the situation of my country, you will know at least someone in that situation) , even for those who never watched Lucha. Eli is the best talker in PW today and he is getting pretty good in ring, Great to see GFW let him has a run with the belt. tbf I\\'d rather have Lawler than Otunga or Booker T. Of course, that\\'s like saying I\\'d rather have herpes than the clap IMO I think he\\'s a better performer than Cody and he could definitely go do something out there if he wanted to, maybe even a Tag team with Cody which would give him instant credibility. But I\\'m not sure he wants to do something  Tbf, WWE has a track record with guys like Braun. Huge guys who\\'s only noticeable quality are their size. He *was* extremely green and he sucked for the longest time. Luckily, he\\'s a guy who isn\\'t getting by with his sheer size and is instead actively improving his work. Compare him now to his first year...definitely one of the biggest improvements I\\'ve seen in wrestling. It also helps just how well booked he\\'s been.  When done right and not overexposed, Stolen Finishers are pretty great spots Thanks TNA didn\\'t and still doesn\\'t have the money and marketing machine that WWE has. Why not just make 2 strong divisions and build for the future Absolutely insane brawl.  Tied with Devitt vs. Tanahashi as the best lumberjack match ever. Here\\'s one I could find https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhePF9xua84\\n\\nIt only lasted maybe 3-4 times and it was slightly different each time if I remember correctly. Taker will do it and no-sell the chair shot. I\\'m not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport! I\\'m not as knowledgeable as some here. How big was Eastern Championship Wrestling compared to other regional companies in the early 90s?  I didn\\'t get the impression they were any bigger than other regional companies at the time. I think they are homosexuals and in a secret relationship.  Do you have a problem with this?  Don\\'t be homophobic, it\\'s 2017 bro. It was definitely Heenan. I work at my job because of the great benefits, and if I were to look for a new one, benefits would be a major factor. \\n\\nBenefits should be on every Americans mind, as many companies are giving folks $5000 high deductible health plans and acting like they\\'re doing a favor Treat! Treat! Treat! Depending on how this is priced, I like the idea of it. If it has every episode of Impact and the NWA:TNA PPV\\'s then that\\'s 100\\'s of hours worth of content. Impact was putting out some amazing stuff from 2004 until about 2007 so it\\'d be nice to catch up with that.  SD barely has time for the midcard not to talk of the cruiserweights. Unless you want them to manage time properly then you\\'re on your own. does PWI have a tag team finisher of the year category ? I am almost 62 and I remember when he came on the scene when I was in HS. He was  in the NWA only a very short time before he really took off.\\n\\nGod; he was such a heel.. When you bury the top talent in 5 minute squash matches you are essentially burying the roster by default by placing a huge powerlevel on a guy. He got squashed one time in 3 years...thats even more long term than Heymans plans.. http://i.imgur.com/abTuJya.jpg According to the recent SQ survey the amount of money is far less than you expect. The answer is they don\\'t. People here, myself included, avoid having medical stuff done because it costs too much. People I know have gone without highly advised or helpful procedures because they can\\'t afford them.\\n\\nIts a really shitty situation and has been for too long.  How\\'s the lag? He never knew the difference between a heel wrestler and a heel announcer. A heel announcer justifies the actions of the heel wrestler and roots for the bad guy. He doesn\\'t give the second most well known announcer in combat sports history a nervous breakdown by being a dick to him irl. More Bang for Your Buck? People have really low standards for these MYC matches. Thats it thanks All right! The Shockmaster! Over The Top Wrestling No problem man. Don\\'t thank me though, go send your love over to the NewLegacyInc guys and the people behind parsec!  He\\'s a vanilla midget, for starters. I\\'LL LOW BLOW YOU ALL I didn\\'t even realize there was a survey I could have taken. Where is it? Yeah, but here we are not talking about who had the enjoyable career or the better ring skill, because if this were the case, they wouldn\\'t be at top 2 or 3 like you listed, they would\\'t even be on the discussion.\\n\\nI never said that it was his fault, I said that if he was on the level of those two, I said that his accomplishments didn\\'t mean as much because the era in which he had those accomplishments, for example you cant say that Ezekiel Jackson had a better career in the WWE because he was world champion adn Roddy Roddy Piper wan\\'t (of course this comparassion is not on the same level but you get the point).\\n\\nI mean you just did, I don\\'t know if you are confussing this conversation with the other that we\\'re having, because in this one you put El Santo and Blue in the top 2 and 3. And of course you are not going to feel this legends as big as someone that lived in Mexico, like I don\\'t feel anything when I see Hogan, but, that\\'s why you can go out and find why they were big and how big they were, with that information you should be able to have an idea, and it\\'s why I don\\'t say that Bryan should go over Hogan in the USA or that Naito should go over Inoki in Japan \"Please eat some shit?\" There is no way Derrick Bateman would have worked. EC3 learnt to rise from the ashes of that failure. Agree 100%! The reason I left my old employer, whom I absolutely loved working for, and sought out employment with the state is because of their tremendous benefits package.  I\\'ve taken bumps before and they had us do a drill where we squatted and fell back. Then do a sit up and hop up quickly and right back down. One of the times on that simply bump, I forgot to keep my chin tucked in and it bounced back and hit the mat. It didn\\'t give me a headache but I was like \"damn that hurts.\" I\\'m sure no one ever told me what to do with his head I\\'ve noticed he hasn\\'t said \"Really?\" In like two years. Being that his background is the Real World I always thought that was a clever catchphrase for him.  Lord, you not knowing that makes me feel so old  I imagine if it\\'s 2 people then at least 1 person needs a controller, right? Like, the 2 people can\\'t both use a keyboard, or am I wrong? Yeah they are going to come out of retirement.  They will be called The Christian Edgers, saying its not gay if you dont bust You\\'re defending people insulting someone who did something wrong, and lashing out at everyone who points it out by calling them misogynist. Have fun being a keyboard warrior. It\\'s been mentioned many many times that Cody had requested repeatedly to stop being Stardust.\\n\\nI\\'m not making the point that you get in trouble for talking to Vince, I\\'m saying it\\'s not some magic get out of the Midcard free pass, because without a bargaining chip, he\\'s going to ignore you. Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman drop the hokey cult gimmick and become southern aristocrats pushing to bring back slavery. Guaranteed heel gimmick that everyone would hate. First feud is against New Day. Wyatts come out on top in the first match and Woods is captured and shackled. He starts working as a slave to the Wyatt Family. Backstage segments ensue with progressively worse treatment of Woods while Big E and Kofi fight with Rowan and Strowman trying to rescue their brethren. Harper, meanwhile, has real compassion and begins to feel bad and helps Woods to escape (this can be done through some sort of Underground Railroad type segment) only to be stopped by Braun. Harper is incapacitated and turned into somewhat of a martyr. Woods, despite being injured, is able to fell the giant and join the New Day once again. This all leads up to a tag team bullwhip on a pole match between Wyatt/Rowan and Kofi/Big E that\\'s won by the latter due to interference from Xavier. Despite the loss, Wyatt reforms and decides to start a new group of hooded figures in white robes that terrorize superstars on a different brand. Rowan becomes a bitter, washed up racist that\\'s treated like a complete jobber. Strowman harbors no anger because he was never truly racist, just looking for financial gains. He makes his money as a hitman of sorts for other heels. Harper is repackaged and returns as a clean cut CPA that works as a pro wrestler in his free time. I just laugh every time Becky hits The Big Show. I identify myself as \"Woo Tangy\" Honest answer? No there\\'s no proof.\\n\\nSmark answer? HHH clearly is on something. From what I\\'m told, there are certain aspects of his physique like his pot belly that are typical of steroid users. Stephanie has a pretty unreal physique, and her husband is on something...educated guess would say she might use as well. One day I will marry that slingshot rear choke.  Awesome job! I love it, Maggle, haha, ballgame! So when is abs vs. abs match with Tony Nese?  Do it.\\n\\nPost one. How the hell did he hurt himself in his entrance? He\\'s 5ft 11. That\\'s not short at all. I hate you That\\'s another Bill Bhatti site.  Because most of the audience has the mind of a child and only responds to cartoonish antics. that’s fair, i think him and Bryan doing creative together would be interesting at the least, but you’re probably right  Trump rally 7 pm? All Scots apparently do. Got a video of Rollins using it? 100% he appears via satellite or video message on RAW monday and gets the crowd to explode into Woooo\\'s Whatever gets you your dream job to work for WWE The WWE works very hard to keep their wrestlers under \"independent contractor\" status so they don\\'t have to give them medical coverage, pensions, or even cover the substantial traveling costs.  Ryback has said they did the invisible pyro for him just as something new because no one else had that at the time. Then they used it again for Nakamura for a few weeks.  True, she\\'s shown more moves then Khali ever did in his run in wwe. I\\'m not saying they are. Impact is my favorite wrestling show. Just so I\\'m clear you think it\\'s a better idea to announce something with no release date while having a bad reputation and force your fans to wait over half a year for it rather than waiting till its actually ready to announce, can give a release date and are able release it in a months time? I want to smell Alexa\\'s hair Do you know what episode is that? When the network debuts after they work the kinks out I might check it out especially if the weekly show is current. One big drawback on wwe network is once someone views what they signed up for the service is blah till the ppvs. Its way to early to speculate on what could be on the gfw network but I hope they go with actual non produced out of character content for shows or hell even interviews/behind the scene stuff just let people be people. I hope what I\\'m trying to say makes sense Sad Bret/ Owen hart  The \"absurd absolute\" is a tell for cognitive dissonance. Ok. That\\'s an argument that doesn\\'t exist here. Veering off topic. You are such a hero. TAP! TAP! TAP! TAP! Ya but still.. Seth Rollins and Neville had a twenty minute match, I think I was Rollins. The game showed them shaking hands after the match, which was a cool touch. They went on to form a team. When I simulated the rest of the year to WM, they were on the card defending the tag straps. god i want eve marie to cheat on me.. She\\'s more over than Sasha recently. Also judging if a push is good or not based on how over someone is isn\\'t very logical, especially for a heel. It\\'s a parody of you.  You obviously hate women and minorities. As a fan of stables, the Hardys, and the Miz, I would like this.  Yikes, glad to hear you (and your wallet) are ok. It\\'s scary to get really sick here... a lot of the time you could be more worried about the impending bill than your health which is totally fucked up. This is just a dream come true The good ol days of TNAVault and Brown Bag Specials being shilled.  Bruce pitchard is known to be full of shit most of the times I thought jokes had to be funny though Your ears had one job! Same man, at first I was like \"HOLY SHIT WHATS HBK DOING HERE\" then i was like \"Oh, he\\'s dressed up as Colonel Sanders.\" As an American, thank you. I had no idea what he was saying, especially calling the kid a wee rat, which I thought could be another way to say mouse, which with disney, I misunderstood to be some vague mickey reference.  &gt;[**Tom Lawlor vs. Ariel Gandulla [1:04]**](http://youtu.be/dvXNUh-HiOk)\\n\\n&gt;&gt;tom lawlor vs. ariel gandulla from unified cage fights in ft. myers 3/10/2007\\n\\n&gt; [*^Tom ^Lawlor*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRlcaFRYQjTPS7d6MSADGg) ^in ^Sports\\n\\n&gt;*^16,096 ^views ^since ^Mar ^2007*\\n\\n[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) I\\'d go gay for edge I think Eddie Guerrero was the epitome of this. He really worked to his opponents strengths and was super versatile. I know a lot of wrestlers that can work a variety of styles, but no one has ever really matched the versatility that Eddie had. Benoit came the closest. They were great for years and then went to shit and lost 60 million dollars in a year. she gets pretty decent pops when her music hits so id say she\\'s pretty over  Woooooooooooooooooo That\\'s basically what they do now, only instead of a schlub it\\'s an army of fembots.  I know she isn\\'t a great wrestler but from watching PPVs, she seems decent enough. She\\'s over and OK in the ring. Why is there so much hate here? His run of retweeting \\'Dugs\\' the other day was magnificent. Noam Dar is a social media superstar. I have never felt this worked in eons.

The answer, obviously, is no Well at last Becky looks good Leonardo di Caprio in Django Unchained.\\n\\nShattered a glass in his hand, blood squirting everywhere, but Leo just kept going with the scene. It is an almost daily post on /r/todayilearned  Put that up there with the rest of the quotes. By the looks of it hes gonna feud with Braxton.\\n\\nHe has a lot of potencial. What are you talking about buddy? He\\'s not a monster She\\'s like the Trish Stratus of the modern era. What are the lyrics anyway Because CM Punk did it in one episode of NXT over 7 years ago and it was funny because it was spontaneous and worked in context. JBL has said it constantly for ages whether it\\'s funny or not and made it his catch phrase, even though it wasn\\'t all that funny, only tangentially supported his \"heel announcer\" persona Dormammu, I\\'ve come to bargain! What moves he does? Yes kicks? You dont need much skill for those Yeah, you are correct on that.  Rampage Jackson, who I got from community creations, holds MITB and I\\'m thinking of having him cash in at Summerslam on WWE Champion Big Show, assuming Show holds the title until then. Tyson Kidd was great at this. Christian as well.  Wish they\\'d just straight up allow intergender matches though. Instead, anytime they interact the girls do their moves on the guys and that\\'s the end of it.\\n\\nThe dream is for Asuka to go undefeated on the main roster too and decide she wants to fight the guys lmao She\\'s over but not more than Becky or Charlotte  RIP Cody &gt; Because CM Punk did it in one episode of NXT over 7 years ago and it was funny\\n\\nWas it though?\\n\\nBecause it kind of seems from the fact that you\\'re here trying to explain how amazing it was, that it wasn\\'t all that and JBL\\'s version actually was funny. &gt; Brown Bag Specials \\n\\nThey still do those and I hope if the company rises again they don\\'t get rid of them  Huh. TIL! Thank you for this. Alexa has now been wrestling for 4 years. When Trish had wrestled by that long she\\'d already gotten pretty good. Ehhh I really think she should just be herself. Bad acting is bad.  She\\'s way more over than Sasha lol. Sasha has done nothing since being on the main roster. Her promos are cringey and her voice is annoying. The matches with Charlotte were botch city too. Yes I\\'m ready for the down votes  AJ Styles He looks like he aged twenty years in just a few months.  Just look up the NL videos and you\\'ll see Same with Alexa.  The Amped shows are being used for 4 One Night Only PPV. They filmed like 12 or 13 hour long episodes, and have edited them to make 3 hour PPVs.\\n\\nI watched the first one, and it was pretty good.  I guess It\\'d be nice if they went the extra step and polished up the better ones to full pieces of music rather than the more loop/theme style they favour, but I love a lot of their work regardless. \\n I can\\'t even think of what the second best would be.  That has to be #1 by a mile *WOOOOO* She still sucks though? Nia has had better matches with Sasha and Bayley than she has. What does that say about her work ethic? If you think they push people because of how good they are at their job take a look at the WWE Champion. how? Alexa threads are always fun to watch unfold. I mean, in the UK, rats can mean actual rats, tiny dogs or annoying children. He tore his labrum or rotator cuff while he was standing on the steel steps outside prior to getting into the ring as he was throwing his arms up into the air. You can clearly see his reaction as he does it and starts pulling on it like it was a dislocation.  I guess by definition for it to be racist you would have to say  \"Since I\\'m a white guy I\\'m better than those criminal black guys\" or something. Nigel McGuinness Man you need to learn the power of /s 80% of roster is good/great in ring, have to do something else well to separate yourself from the pack, Balor is small, not the best talker and has not much of a character.\\n\\nI\\'d argue that if he didn\\'t come from Japan he\\'d have much less of a following than he does right now I love Lucha Underground - but things are looking worrisome for its future (if not the promotion itself, then definitely the current roster). If these guys *must* leave the Temple, then I hope they end up somewhere that I can watch with regularity, and are given a chance to do their thing. Pentagon has been doing a lot of indie spots, but he seems the type that would benefit from being a reoccurring character on a weekly show, rather than doing a bunch of one-offs.  is that actually their name? sorry didn\\'t realize that mate Yea for like 2 years now. I agree with everything you said.\\n\\nHe\\'s still never had a great match.  Good just to see him. But is he going to be the Doctor of Flair-o-nomics (aka broke) or some old white rapper gimmick now?  Yeah but as someone who doesn\\'t watch GFW regularly and already has the WWE network, I\\'m not spending another $120 a year for GFW.  **KIIINNNNNSSSSHHHHAAAAASSSSSAAAAA** She is? They\\'re pretty bland. His lack of character is a part of that, but he rarely comes across passionate...similar to what Reigns lacks in his promos. Yes, I replace educated feet with Samoan head  Her push, 4 time champ in a year, she has pretty much been champ or in the title picture since her debut.  Once she got to RAW her booking was also ass backwards.  A 5 foot women who is booked as some dominant heel is stupid.   Top 5 period. I can\\'t think of many guys currently besides Enzo, WWE or not, who could compete with him on the mic. You talking about Bryan?  allways happy when a new episode of being the elite is in my feed,this is gonna be fun to watch for sure &gt; He chopped Roman across the chest and immediately shouted out clutching his own wrist. Never change, KO.\\n\\nThey uploaded this on their youtube channel, the whole match. When I first watched it I missed how KO sells Roman\\'s vest.\\n\\nThat dude is just amazing. Best heel package in the company ( Miz is better on the mic, but KO has way better matches ) That\\'s fair These two will have a career long feud/friendship storyline similar to HHH/HBK. Pretty great so far Im guessing otunga unfortunately. He didn\\'t create #3, #3 didn\\'t exist until ECW. Before them, it was WWE, WCW, and whatever gutted regional you liked.

Nice. General admission?\\n\\nI\\'m hoping to be there in an hour or so, hopefully traffic isn\\'t a bitch. this was gonna be my entry ... good call No problem! Glad you liked it. I mean as a character on main roster, he hasn\\'t really had any memorable promos or anything, only interesting things to me about him are the running kick on the apron and his entrance. He comes off really bland to me otherwise, doesn\\'t show much emotion or passion, more like he just came there to get the match over with. And this was also before the beachball stuff You\\'re straight up lying, both Anthem and GFW didn\\'t say anything until Reby and Matt threw a shitfit over it and they then had to go public. The absolute goal posts you\\'re moving to fit your blatant made up lie just shows how embarrassing this sub is.  But Braun still went over him at the end of that match.  If that was Roman, we would get \"sigh Roman still ended up looking strong though\".  If Roman had this same exact booking/shtick, this post would have been \"Roman is a fucking cartoon and I hate it\". Sorry I think I\\'m missing an essential step in the reasoning:\\n\\n1. Hardcore fans will always watch WWE no matter what.\\n2. Hardcore fans alone are not enough to keep WWE going.\\n3. The casual audience is declining because of poor booking.\\n\\nHardcore fans prevent good booking... Somehow? That\\'s not really made clear in the argument. I mean, if the hardcore fans aren\\'t acting as a safety net, then there\\'s no cause for the complacency in the booking. \\n\\n\\nIt would only make sense if hardcore fans were enough to keep WWE profitable no matter what. But you\\'ve decided that WWE is *\\'going out of business soon\\'* so that\\'s clearly not the case. Wasn\\'t he also the ref during the Bash at the Beach main event?\\n Him and Eli make for a good team.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD1uEZvIMaA\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S0K5Uxf6NM\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10udoKbbzdw Takes some balls to do this in front of a UFC crowd. With Authority please Any time he\\'s in a multi-man opener against Suzukigun. The openers of the final two nights of the G1 were really good.\\n\\nThere was one show in Korakuen that had a hot multiman match with him, Liger, and I think Tiger vs Desperado, Iizuka, and someone else. Phenomenal outing. She\\'s not getting monster pops however most fans are male so she\\'s damn over with a section of them for her um \"work rate\" (looks) no denying that. She\\'s not a bad promo actually one of the better females on the mic her wrestling isn\\'t great but she\\'s certainly not Eva Marie level bad. Her monster push is because Vince likes her um \"work rate\" (hot blonde) I think a sad Hardy Boyz theme would be interesting to hear. Just dont goto doctors and hope you dont die, so far so good! You know what? I\\'ll put my money where my mouth is - I\\'ll watch an episode of Impact just because this Gem of a Man is their world champion. I need more of Eli Drake in my life, and if you\\'re not down with that...you\\'re a dummy! YEAH! I\\'ve been enjoying gfw immensely for the past few weeks. They got enough talented wrestlers to produce a good show, once they get behind them, eli drake is one example. The addition of jim cornette is just the icing on the cake. If I was five I wouldn\\'t understand a damn thing you just said Of Punjabi!?! And JB doing the Spin Cycle web series..and when they attempted to call their fan base the \"TNAtion\" as a direct response to the \" WWE Universe\" He\\'s been wrestling for less than a year but has a very strong connection with the crowd. He\\'s a great underdog and when he plays it up he\\'s a standout each time. Well yeah, of course people like you, the net takers, don\\'t see a problem with that arrangement, and can\\'t fathom why that would result in long term problems for everyone else, the net payers.\\n\\n Match was amazing too. Probably my favorite SS match ever and one of my favorite WWE matches ever  $200 for a $30000 surgery sounds unreal to me. My insurance makes me pay $5000 out of pocket before it even kicks in. Then I pay 50% up to $2000. After that my insurance pays the rest.  Course not. Most criticism of WWE nowadays is directed at the booking rather than the wrestlers themselves I would say Naomi more over then Bex As if Vince didn\\'t bury them already month\\'s ago? A testament on how safe of a worker Bret Hart was. Made everything look real, and Perfect never felt a thing. So I know it\\'s really a no-no to call a wrestler by their name, but he\\'s had so many gimmicks over the years what would you even go with? I mean, I guess Xpac works, but is this a case where just calling him Sean is okay? Bret is a whiney bitch Their match was 5 stars to me also. Only reason it got overshadowed was Bryan vs Cena was the main event and all the shenanigans that happened. Even Christian vs del rio was great.\\n\\nSummerslam 2013 was the greatest WWE ppv in the last 10 years. He is the wrestling worlds best kept secret fan.  \\n\\nBtw nice touch by Rogan \"he is ready to shock the world!\" The Modern Day Mamaraja For a second I thought Bo Dallas was D-Lo Brown and got a bit excited Bryan by his own admission admitted lying about having concussions. It\\'s the reason why they didn\\'t sign Nigel McGuinness when he was still wrestling I cant remember when this was said about him? Ishii should have an eternally injured everything the way he wrestles.  I think in the future they should.  Like 5 years but let them build it up.  \\n\\nIm still shocked TNA womens tag titles were never om angelina love and velvet sky Not until they get some more NXT callups to add depth and creative prove they can actually write stories for multiple women at once Yeah, what else would they call it?  I think providing for &amp; helping protect the US is a bit more important than fake fighting &gt; Literally what they have done with Lesnar for the last 3 years..\\n\\nLesnar\\'s never beaten Roman ( in singles ), AJ, Nakamura, Balor, Braun and he barely beat Joe.\\n\\nThere are plenty who were protected from him. Fucking Nandos.  Can we stop giving Billi Bhatti and sites associated with him attention? This shit\\'s getting out of control. Honestly makes me love the NHS so much Greetin faced weans man This one is amazing! $$$ \"If you\\'re broke, we can fix it!\" lol Lesnar\\'s entrance looks dumb as fuck without pyro The end is neigh! We\\'re gonna have to get out of the Total Divas Division we\\'re in and back into a real women\\'s division first. Then we can talk Women\\'s tag titles. nah, Alexa gets a big pop almost everywhere now She gets babyface pops here and there, definitely doesn\\'t come out to silence as people on here like to believe. Not as over as the horsewomen obviously but I\\'d say shes getting there slowly. \\n\\nAlso contrary to popular belief, her fanbase doesn\\'t consist of only overweight m\\'lady neckbeards. There are good amount of women, kids, and regular dudes that are fans as well. Whatever vOv how does greet translate into cry Great to see him feeling better! He has a picc line so I guess he either needs long-term anitbiotics or a heart issue, right? Leave it to JBL to start rattling off his career accomplishments in a tweet about his charity If you were five I\\'d say get the hell off the internet, listen to your parents, brush your teeth, or I will layeth the smacketh down on your candy ass. Looks like a PICC line in his upper arm.  My guess antibiotic treatment for endocarditis since they said heart surgery.  Wouldn\\'t surprise me if had a valve replaced. What\\'s wrong with a bromance? You seem to have left out or forgotten HOW he beat Cena at WM27, The Rock snuck up behind Cena, put a Rock Bottom on Cena and Miz took the opportunity to pin Cena. ÜBERSETZUNG: \"Kinder die in Disneyland weinen hauen mich um. Solange Baloo der Bär dir nicht deine Eiskreme geklaut hat und dir sagt dass du dich verpissen sollst hast du keinen Grund zu heulen, du kleiner Scheisser.\" can you imagine goldbergs entrance without the sparks? This is what I think will happen. They obviously didn\\'t want him on Raw, so why not shove him on Smackdown Can we all agree that after a lifetime of plane crashes, bumps, blades, booze and all this 20% chance of survival stuff - this old motherfucker still looks amazing?\\n\\nWooooooooooooo.\\nGod bless you Ric. You\\'re like my dad. So high with standards. I\\'d be okay with this as long as two things happened.  \\n\\nThe first would be to end brand extension.  This may seem unrelated?  But brand extension is so harmful to the legitimacy of any title that it\\'s almost the go to \"first step\" for fixing any wwe related problem.  \\n\\nThe second thing would be to have only one championship.  You have your women\\'s world title.  Then you have the tag team title.  That\\'s it.  Two belts that both mean something as long as you do them right.   Corbin\\'s into some weird shit tho but were on ODB and eric young. Hasn\\'t got much of a character, has a pretty limited move set (The moves he does have are pretty cool though) I\\'d say that he has a good look, good theme and his demon character is ridiculously over with the fans\\n\\nI think he should join up with The Club or maybe do some shit with Bullet Club members that may come to WWE, as a solo competitor I just don\\'t find his character engaging enough and I wouldn\\'t say he\\'s too good on the mic\\n\\nI also think he was pushed WAY too hard when he first came up from NXT Dustin Runnels as \"Seven\" in WCW. I\\'m still praying we get Mauro back on SDL now that JBL is gone Supershows ended up killing the original brand split. rag titles where the women\\'s title is just a rag Damn, that referee is real jacked baby Should\\'ve asked Simon Miller  Kavita\\'s gear was terrible  [This didn\\'t help either](https://gfycat.com/ShockedExcitableItalianbrownbear) Came in to post this one. Definitely one of my favorite WWE tag matches. &gt; should of \\n\\n Did you mean should have? \\n\\n-------------------------------------- \\nThis is a bot account. Only because she\\'s Indian and they have 1.3 billion people. Go watch the video of Taynara Conti and it\\'s just endless amount of people talking about how Brazilian they are  Fantastic promo as per by Eli.\\n\\nOn a side note, Chris Masters suit is horrid. If all of them were on one brand maybe. Another was when Benoit left WcW as champ Russo\\'s big idea was to have a battle royal for the title and have tank abott win it and when Terry Taylor asked \"why would we do that\" he said \"because if this was a shoot bro thats what would happen\" and Russo was immediately taken off creative and sent home.   That would be straight fire. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Alexa 1-upped Paige and made the current women\\'s title a cum rag title I see your bayley and raise you a sami zayn at this point, im over him not using it.\\n\\nim now on board with absolutely hating his current finisher, and hte way its executed, and thinking he REALLY should start using the Frog Splash Noam Dar reminds me of those people on TUF who needed subtitles.  Strowman\\'s would be badass with pyro  Nope. Nixon Newell was supposed to be in it but got injured, so she\\'s just chilling in Florida at the moment, but her replacement was Miranda Silinas who lost to Rhea Ripley.\\n\\nKay Lee Ray was always supposed to be in it. My take on her exit in the first round was that Princessa Sugehit was a) the only competitor from Mexico, a bg wrestling market, and b) the only \"Lucha\" type character, so was something different.  Not on Sharkboys level... CAN I GET A SHELL YEAH!!  Kishin Liger was Jushin Thunder Liger\\'s alter ego he brought out a few times.  He\\'s given leeway BECAUSE he can carry himself on the mic not the other way around. Tell someone who can\\'t talk to adlib it and you\\'ll see the wrestling equivalent of a car crash. Oh man, the night not even a Lumberjack match could hold those two in a ring. The only person I can think of that it happened with in WWE is Miz He literally said he\\'s hear to shock the world referencing the damn promo That\\'s bullshit cause they\\'ve definitely got money! I\\'m sure a few fireworks is pennies to them  Yoshi Tatsu would like a word. I thought you had posted that you stream it, never mind, you\\'re the guy that took the give-away shirt and then complained it was a 50/50 poly blend and wasn\\'t made of combed cotton.  I think part of the reason it\\'s so enjoyable so far is that it\\'s being treated as more of a sport and less entertainment like the main roster is. It makes a big difference. Wrestling first, gimmicks second. Yeah he wrote what Lawlor gave him. You can hear it in his tone. He wasn\\'t in on it Wasn\\'t Maroon portrayed badly in the Concussion movie? This WWE stooge thing turned into a horror movie real fast.  Must be a Boston fan Anyone with an IV lock dangling from their arm, while technically _not dead yet_, isn\\'t exactly \"outperforming the market\". Oh great, now I want to have sex with Juice Robinson.  Heel Cole was a goldmine &gt;They better not fuck it up.\\n\\n&gt;GFW\\n\\n&gt; fuck it up\\n\\n[INB4 Eli gets a new gimmick as a spokesperson for the most powerful financial literacy program in existence today.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?amp=&amp;v=gDLZGSEZOmc) It was nothing to write home about ....also edge\\'s last match I believe  I feel it\\'s moreso a commentary regarding the fact that WWE chooses to separate the CW division from the rest of the roster and treat them like the kids table on Thanksgiving. \"Hello, fellow students!\" who? As a Scot I can attest to that  Because wrestling was better in the past Aries didn\\'t want to be a cruiserweight if he wasn\\'t gonna be on top of the division. That\\'s why he left. I agree he woulda been great outside the division but I guess WWE only wanted him to be a 205er. I didn\\'t know he was injured Just a stylistic thing with no real big meaning, and usually it\\'s the last name of a wrestler. I\\'d also assume it\\'s easier to promote oneself like that.  And sadly, I doubt we\\'re gonna have it for much longer. Not with this Tory government. If you look at the men\\'s division on Smackdown, there are 4 championship titles to be held split between 36 wrestlers, or 9 wrestlers per title. That\\'s already more than the women\\'s division, which has 8 women competing for one title.\\n\\nI think they\\'d need at least 15 women in the division before they started thinking about adding a second championship.

And, that you\\'ll be out and about. Why not do it a new car? Let me tell you about my friends at TrueCar.com! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDTiFkXgEE \"Do WWE fans deserve to be criticized?\"\\n\\nThat\\'s a very broad question. You are looking at the results and interpreting them to suit your bias. Not to mention you have fewer than 100 responses, when *millions* of people are watching each Raw and Smackdown.\\n\\nMaybe try expanding the survey to get a better picture.  You definitely need more responses before you can draw any conclusions, including demographic info for those responding. They aren\\'t filling up, and they don\\'t  Here is a direct link to the [podcast](http://www.sportsnet.ca/590/top-turnbuckle/top-turnbuckle-nxt-champion-drew-mcintyre-calls-in/) He could do it coming out Because as people get older they tend to view what they experienced growing up as the best experience.\\n\\nIt\\'s the same reason why people always get offended when it is suggested LeBron James *could be* better than Michael Jordan. If James is better than it means what they experienced in with Jordan is less significant. \\n\\nPeople are looking at it from a zero-sum scenario. Because our wrestling might be better, yours is somehow worse. Cheeky Nandos. Aesthetics. I think grammar mistakes and such are no big deal. I\\'ll be honest unless someone is in highschool no one gives a shit. This site is worldwide. English isn\\'t everyone\\'s native language as long as someone gets their point across wanna be English majors shouldn\\'t be trying to correct everything they see I\\'d assume they\\'d have everything.\\n\\nRemember a few years ago when Jarrett announced GFW for the first time, stating it would be a one-stop shop for global promotions and talent to be seen in one place for ease of access to their shows and inte-promotional dream matches?\\n\\nLooks like his vision is really starting to come together. Guys you\\'re missing out on the point!  The point is!  \\n\\nTracy Grind is gonna learn, in just one day!  \\n\\nWho the greatest pro wrestler in HCDubya is!  \\n\\nWoooooooooooo!!!\\n\\nIt\\'s the Dog! I think it\\'s just the human nostalgia bias. For some people it seems that everything is always at it\\'s best just after they start watching it. Regardless of quality. Nostalgia is a thing that permeates all aspects of art and culture. Wrestling is no different. We get older. Things are amazing and awesome in our brains when we\\'re kids and teens.  We\\'re all jaded and cynical now. Can I just ask what\\'s the point of posting every link to everyone in the wrestling industry saying the exact same thing about Sexy Star? Good try, not funny  And now a McMahon is running the Small Business Administration. Profits are lower than projected so they need to cut costs. they do, yet they don\\'t have enough women in each show for it. They are GFW\\'s Impact. It\\'s full on amalgamation I honestly hadn\\'t noticed. I watch the PPVs but rarely bother watching more than a match or two from Raw or SD. Not as much as most people think. Bischoff has complained before about them half-assing a lot of stuff he suggested, or just outright ignoring his advice. For instance, his plan was to rebrand the whole company as Impact, not just the main tv show, because he wanted to do away with the TNA name. They ended up only going halfway.   73 Though I only understood about 50% of this, upvote.

Becky\\'s fanbase just won\\'t allow any other praise for another woman to get too many upvotes.

No it isn\\'t Direct link to the [podcast](http://www.sportsnet.ca/590/top-turnbuckle/top-turnbuckle-nxt-champion-drew-mcintyre-calls-in/). Well, first of all I don\\'t know if that method works with all games (could be wrong tho). Also, with THIS method it\\'s much easier to connect with friends and only one person needs to have the emulator and whatever else needed to play the game installed. So it\\'s an all around easier,simpler experience. Don\\'t know how the lag and input delay compares between the two, but seeing as there is very little of such issues while using parsec, I don\\'t think that the kaillera method would be any better in that regard. Lawler told a nice story on his podcast about Ricky Steamboat visiting Flair in the hospital recently: https://youtu.be/uYhPhRXI9Tg You don\\'t need a spoiler tag for a match that happened 9 years ago.  Because it could be percy. Off the top of my head, Big Show as \"The Showster\" (*Backlash 2000*). It was a quality impersonation. Match: [Moss &amp; Slater vs. Die Jungen Löwen vs. SCC WCPW Loaded: August 31, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI8Z4PyxO-Q) \\n\\nJohnny Moss is pretty much WCPW\\'s version of Goldberg, if you\\'ve never watched it, I\\'d highly recommend one of my favorite matches ever when [Johnny Moss faught British Strong Style member Trent Seven during WCPW Loaded #13.5](https://youtu.be/IH67UKVZqwo), even blood is shed during this complete brawl Crispy. he still pinned Cena at the end of the day that will mean an awful lot Yeah, his actual stance is whatever his employer wants him to say.

No, it was a colemine. Kanji to Alphabet \"translation\", MAYBE ? I actually have really \"good\" insurance, and still, when I had a medical emergency that nearly cost me my life we racked up like eight or ten grand in out of pocket costs we had to pay. Lesnar looks like he could kill a deer with his bare hands\\n\\nBryan looked like a homeless lumberjack I\\'m tha Chippa, babe. why dont they spare a few bucks for peoples entrances that require fireworks for at LEAST their payperview entrances? i mean seriously how much crazy money is it  Wasn\\'t it established that the \"bullying campaign\" bit was the signal that he had finished the promo and they could cut his mic off? Or maybe Bliss is just a shit wrestler I think that Rollins was the right choice. Not only was he shit hot upon returning, the stars lined up so Reigns would lose to Rollins who would lose to Ambrose. It was perfect like that.\\n\\nAlso, without spoilers, how is his latest book? Everything about Rude in WCW was amazing.\\n\\nIf only he hadn\\'t had that back injury... That\\'s why we love the guy Damn almost 80% of the callups since 2015 haven\\'t won a single thing. New stats every week that show how much of an incompetent dumbass Vince is. Its astonishing  WOOOOOOOOOO! She comes across as better in the ring than she actually is because she\\'s wrestling Sasha and Bayley. Outside of that, she\\'s awful. Probably the reason they got rid of the Dudley Boyz, pyro costs through the roof!!! Lol I bet Hangmans Power is invisibility, like how Cody has super hearing and Marty has pause and play powers. Curt Hawkins taking the Big Banter crown off Corbin\\'s corpse. *slaps head* Ah I see. Thanks for explaining.  They\\'ll probably put David Otunga in, considering he was supposed to take back over from Booker a while ago It\\'s a different time now, back then being a fan meant they probably just saw him as a mark. Nowadays the locker room is full of people who grew up on wrestling, less of that stigma Well, it saved Ambrose from losing another one of his feuds, that\\'s for sure.  Huh, didn\\'t know Marty was a Stand user Hulu has 30 day exclusivity. Americans: Will happily pay taxes for armed forces and nuclear weapons but social health care? Fuck that. I really wish Moss &amp; Slater appeared more but they just get injured so damn much Sexy Star is a stupid cunt slut.  Upvotes please.

For those wanting Asuka on the main roster, it would just be a question of which Total Diva would she be fed to and buried by. I\\'m not overly familiar with his work, but that promo seems like Ric Flair mixed with the Rock to me lol. Great promo. i wish.\\n\\nit would be the biggest insult that WWE can do to punk. They just made their return 2 days ago, so don\\'t be down!  &gt;almost everyone\\'s entrance \\n\\nHornswoggle and El Toritio are literally the only two examples in at least the last 20 years.  I have no idea how well this would translate in practice, but I feel like a deeply melancholic rendition of Zack Ryder\\'s \"Radio\" is not only appropriate, but something we may need in our lives.  Nakamura and Roode get a pass since not much time has passed and they\\'ll probably win, but the lack of anything decent for Sami is depressing. WrestleMania 34 (35? Now that they\\'ve stopped numbering them, I don\\'t know where we are. Whatever the next one is). Pre-show. The lights go down. The crowd begin to stir. The gong sounds. The crowd roars. The Undertaker walks to the ring one last time, wearing a KFC-branded, red leather coat, hair dyed white and grey beard grown out. We see the whites of his eyes from behind black, thick-rimmed glasses as lightning strikes and smoke fills the rampway. Trailing behind him is  a hologram of Paul Bearer clutching tightly to his chest not an urn but a large KFC bucket. Cut to WrestleMania opening video package. When we return to live action, The Undertaker is gone and no mention of him is made again on the broadcast. &gt; And Cody? Cody asked for his release. Cody was being heavily featured up until his departure. He wasn\\'t punished for talking to Vince. Vince just didn\\'t agree with him and went with his own plan instead. That also happened to Stone Cold, Rock, Triple H, STEPHANIE MCMAHON.\\n&gt; Just because you open up a relationship with Vince doesn\\'t mean he\\'s always going to listen. He didn\\'t always listen when he was going out of business against WCW and he didn\\'t listen when he was going out of business before WM1. Competition has nothing to do with it really. OOHH BRING IT BUDDY *flexes arm flab* 22 Looks like shit People sign up mainly because free college. She seems like one of the first round eliminations that was made because she doesn\\'t need the rub from the tournament.  \\n\\nIf KLR signs with NXT, she can probably get herself over.\\n\\nSimilarly, Vanessa Bourne took the L because *jesus*, there\\'s no way she\\'s not getting a real push once she\\'s put in more time at the performance center.  Just look at her.  Just look at that moveset, the Somoan Drop and the knee-slide headbutt, on someone with her build instead of a typical Samoan monster. If the MYC turns into a regular thing, I can easily see her winning it in a few years.\\n\\n... and that\\'s how my post turned into me marking out about Vanessa Bourne, I guess? NXT has a questionable record when it comes to instilling charisma in people. I have my suspicions that Corey was ready to go on the mic long before he saw the performance centre. Maybe the good just make it look natural. &gt; If Ric Flair has hard time paying medical bills, \\n\\nNot defending Americas Batshit health care system but he has at least 4 ex wives so his outgoings are huge! Put Vic Joseph somewhere. He\\'s good. That\\'s most likely what Corbin was speaking out against.\\n\\nIDK when this meeting was, but it may have been shorty after late July when a study of the brains of deceased NFL players revealed 99% of them had CTE.\\n\\nMaroon has gone on record in the past saying CTE is a rare phenomenon so the WWE may have brought him there to downplay any fears talent would have after hearing about that study.\\n\\nIf that\\'s the case, good on Corbin for speaking out. Could you imagine bumping into the bucks in a Scottish Asda ? It\\'s funny you write that, that other guy attacked me in the first place for complaining about that very system, and told me I \"don\\'t understand economics\". I am the one that attacked the system, those two clowns attacked me in support of it.  They are hemorrhaging money  &amp; they won\\'t last long if that\\'s the only reason why I believe this was when he originally left WWE at the end of 2006. He was probably asked to join TNA in 2007. IT\\'S FUCKING BERENSTEIN BEARS AND NOT BERENSTAIN He was a friend of a friend. We followed each other on Twitter.\\n\\nHw was just a fun dude who loved wrestling. My heart breaks for his family and his friends. A lot have a sub, but a surprising many have never been to a show or bought mercy...https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle They probably wouldn\\'t give her a title, for....reasons Fair enough. I saw your comment as supporting in that it wasn\\'t explicitly rejecting it. Sorry if I got my wires crossed. Yes, I\\'m sure getting her paycheck from WWE, E!, the Nic Cage movies, Instagram ads and her fashion line just pale in comparison to Alexa.\\n\\n I thought Jericho was gonna feud with Reigns after he beat AJ at Wrestlemania 32 so this doesn\\'t sound that surprising  I\\'m hoping Hangman just chose that moment to go take a shit. It seems like the TNA tag titles were made for Love and Velvet. Also, mobile Reddit nests weirdly, so I probably got confused. Sorry. OHHHHHHHH YEAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!\\n\\nAnyway, sadly I had a flood in my house and lost a bunch of my old WWF magazines from the late 80s &amp; early 90s, so I saw a bunch of these little easter eggs. I think Shane McMahon did a little bit of modelling as well.  He\\'s off them NOW but he wasn\\'t employed when they sent Eva to him. Clearly Eva cleaned up his act and got him the CW Classic gig. Always giving back to the wrestling community that Eva. You sure he wasn\\'t a colemine? I\\'m pretty out of it, so when I saw that the link was to charlotteobserver.com, my brain thought that it was a creepily detailed, obsessive fansite about Charlotte.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"hey guys, it me, the Charlotte Observer, and I\\'m here to tell you about my observations of Charlotte this week.  remember to hit that \\'like\\' button and subscribe.  \\n\\nso i was sitting in the bushes outside the hospital, waiting to see if Charlotte would come outside and ...\"  \\n\\nEDIT: omg i saw the rest of the comments and now i realize that i was seven hours late with this, but it remains true. 4.99 would be my price limit for this, and that\\'s if it comes with the impact episodes. 2016 July to 2017 July. Summerslam 16, g126, g127,    lots of good takeovers, UK tournament, mania.  With the most Triple H finish of all time. I get chills. He\\'s my favorite for a reason.  Scottish English is a language of its own at this point. So would Finn\\'s finisher. It was a natural fit. The WWE is a very successful business model from a Republican point of view. Their labor relations issues are a non-issue if you’re pro-corporate/management rather than pro-labor/union. I wonder what they plan on charging for this. I hope they don\\'t expect people to pay the same as they do with the WWE Network. I\\'d pay about 5 bucks a month for the old TNA archives YEAH! Mr. Perfect whelp...I just bought that shirt.  Very happy to see that Ric is back up and running! It still amazes me that only a couple weeks ago a ton of people, including me, thought he was on his death bed. Flair is one tough motherfucker. Wrestlers in Stardom have a different persona for the festival of masks I\\'m gonna need context because this is hilarious Miz. Actually the way he looks and talks right here even reminds me a lot of the Miz. :D God bless this great man *Crowd appears*\\n\\n\\'HE\\'S GOT BILLS!\\'  \\'HE\\'S GOT BILLS!\\'  \\'HE\\'S GOT BILLS!\\' This may come as a shock but throughout the ages people often sign up to the armed services as a way of getting to a better place, not because of national pride or a desire to prove themselves.  Didn\\'t Asuka used to tweet about having \"red nightmares\" back then? Can\\'t wait to relive TNA\\'s golden years.\\n\\nAll three of them. [Couple of minutes playing around with it](http://i.imgur.com/6p6RdFZ.jpg) It should just be a 2 man booth. Well I mean his age plus his lifestyle...not exactly a healthy one. I\\'m also surprised HBK doesn\\'t look ancient.  Real hero in the comments, as usual. If your state has Kaiser, get Kaiser.  its an HMO and has its own annoyances, but I pay 20 bucks to see a doctor, and 15 bucks for prescriptions.  I always thought that he would go no where with this gimmick when he debuted. Glad I was wrong. He\\'s gonna make a hell of a mayor He\\'s a manlet. And people want him to beat The Beast. The same Beast that said he doesn\\'t give a shit about Heath Slater\\'s kids. The same Beast that almost tore through a cockpit door on a rampage in a plane. Brock Lesnar, The Beast Incarnate, The Conqueror, would swat that fly down, give him one F5 and it\\'d be over. Anything less is a spit in the face to The Beast.  Yep, I was like 13 when he was on The Real World, and I\\'ve never forgotten how much passion and dedication he had about making it to WWE one day. There have been so many times when I see him where he is now (that promo about not getting his moment a couple of weeks ago on Raw was one of those times), and I just think back to watching him on Real World and smile because of how much he wanted to be where he is now. I know he\\'s been there for a long time at this point, but it\\'s still so awesome to see a success story like his. You can watch it on Sky Sports Arena, but obviously that\\'s not cheap. Stupid sexy Juice. Yeah dude.  I like shit that blows up and looks rad.  How is this any different than all of the posts that begin with \"WWE Should...\"? Very, which is good because I like her. I\\'ll take it So, Flair is basically a Super Saiyan?  I have friends in it lol, they absolutely hate it. Obviously they don\\'t represent everyone who enlists, but they went in for the reason you\\'re talking about That\\'s unbelievably absurd. Undertaker was very clearly an undertaker, who worked at a funeral home. Finn Balor wears a leather jacket, and when he gets really mad, he paints his face to become a \"demon\" despite nothing different about his matches. I\\'M A SAD MAN\\n\\n*bwow bwow*  &gt; Not only was he shit hot upon returning\\n\\nThey didn\\'t half manage to fuck that one up though, did they?  Was there live, most brutal match i have seen at one of the wcpw shows. I was front row aswell so the pain was even louder to hear. Seven and Moss are both machines.  Was there as well, can confirm horrible in person. Something about Sexy Star being a cunt.  Also, saying something positive about Ric Flair. mini-angle and mini-taker. Really really warming to Eli Drake, haven\\'t even seen him wrestle but I love his promos One of the main reasons I decided to expatriate out. Healthcare being this massive profit grab, shitty doctors who just pump out prescriptions left and right, leads to people becoming dependent on said drugs. Hell, hospitals in my home town are being shut down and they only have one major hospital serving them, before it use to be three! It is risky to get sick or injured there as it sets you back so much financially... I think it was Ambrose and Roman &gt; To be fair, Brock insisted on opening Randy with elbows to make it more realistic. And he opened him up somewhere on his head.\\n\\nYou sure about that? The way I remember hearing it is that Vince/WWE asked Brock to make Orton bleed with elbows so that they could get guaranteed blood without blading. I love wrestling The only way it will work is if he does the pyro gesture on the stage of his inauguration. Honest question: Are they allowed to include the audio of Cole\\'s debut in that video? I feel like they could get a cease &amp; desist for that. Hell, Little Kuriboh\\'s \"Mark My Words\" video got flagged by WWE recently. a bunch of them attacked drew mcintyre on nxt. Was quite bizarre It\\'s a stylistic choice. Nothing more, nothing less. 60,000 is about what all developmental people make. Anyone on the main roster is making far more than that. 2 The only thing HHH runs is NXT.  On the main shows, it\\'s Vince and Kevin Dunn, as it has been for decades.  Those two are where the problem is.  For example...\\n\\nVince: Roman, I\\'ve got a great catch phrase for you that will really get you over!  You\\'ll go out there and say... \"Sufferin\\' Succotash!\"\\n\\nRoman: Why do you hate me?\\n\\nSo, we\\'re now at the point where UFC, without predetermined outcomes, is better at developing characters and storylines than WWE is.  Of course, Conor would have had a hell of a time getting over if his promos were tightly scripted.\\n\\nVince: Conor?  Who\\'s that?\\n\\nHHH:. Sigh...  Top star at UFC.\\n\\nVince: Isn\\'t that Ken Shamrock? Hope it does well &amp; includes alot of older stuff, as well as archives from their partners No it doesn\\'t. Not true. WWE had a whole minis division in either 2005 and 2006 \"Now I will speak to the 4 million people of New Zealand in my language\"\\n\\n*Ah Kia Ora bros just wanted to say hi to the cuzzies back in South Auckland. Churr* Mention Triple H and a shovel. \"What are some of your guys\\' unpopular opinions? For me, I think the Omega vs Okada matches are very overra- A fucking lot Not to mention, WWE have been cutting away for years but people still do it anyway. That color is just on the precipice of neon. If it was a few shades darker I\\'d be all in You joke, but I totally just bought the Space Mountain shirt. That thing is fan-fucking-tastic. Darren Young vs Titus O\\'Neal. It was at the Raw that KO won the title. A standing room only sellout in Reseda is around 500 people. Earlier this month GFW did over 1000 for a house show (though to be fair they also had a house show that drew less than 500 around the same time). To say that PWG has consistently bigger crowds is ridiculous.\\n\\nROH is probably getting bigger crowds on the regular, but it just isn\\'t possible for PWG with their venue. Really? I stand corrected if that\\'s the case. Wish he\\'d make it a regular thing though. God, the way Cena said the \"It\\'s a promo\" line was so good until it was followed up with \"SeE yA fOuRTh wALL!11!\" Seems like most Sasha fans have beef with Alexa these days Pretty sure this never happened and even if it did, that\\'s still the wrong decision to turn down TD. I read that in Jeff Jarret\\'s voice I and now I am terrified of this really happening.  Lookin\\' real jacked baby! You clearly have never seen a single Finn Bálor match  Jim Cornette is old and out of touch\\n\\nDave Meltzer is overrated\\n\\n31 days of gifs that get reposted every few weeks\\n\\nSasha is the GOAT\\n\\nAds on the network suck, I already pay why do I see ads!\\n\\nRoman should turn heel\\n\\nCena should turn heel\\n\\nDean should turn heel\\n\\nSeth should turn heel\\n\\nTake your pick It lasted like 2 months and I can only think of maybe 3 or 4 matches that ever took place for it. \\n\\nAnd this is not at all what OP is referencing. **GIVE ME A FUCKING MIC**   If only it stuck the landing. The rest of the show was amazing. Thanks for your hard work, very interesting! HERES WHY Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m not from America, but I disagree, the anti-American gimmick isn\\'t always bad. Kenny Omega is the best wrestler in the world\\n\\nI would go gay for Finn Balor\\n\\nJinder Mahal is boring\\n\\nLuke Harper is underrated \\n\\n Its not only TNA, its Crash, AAA, Noah and Smash too apparently. Why do so many people want these titles? It\\'s a horrible concept. \\n\\nIf anything, there should be a secondary women\\'s championship, something like US or IC championship for the women. And even without those, WWE has too many titles. GET YER RAT OOT Look how jacked Nigel was there. \\n\\nTalk about a stupid and uncomfortable spot. I find nothing enjoyable, hardcore or entertaining by that. \\n\\nEDIT: shame on both Nigel &amp; Bryan.  Lol cmon Well there\\'s one of the reasons I stopped watching wwe programming gone. Somebody tell me when they start telling good stories and stop insulting people\\'s intelligence.  That\\'s a shame. They fucking suck.  parroting meltzer\\'s opinion. That 60K was less than what she was making in Japan. It\\'s entirely probable that for an NXT indie signing, that is the norm. I guess I\\'m curious as to whether or not she comes back at all. \\n\\nI keep thinking of Trips saying they couldn\\'t put Chyna into the hall of fame because they didnt want a young kid Googling her and seeing what would come up. Granted, the Chyna stuff is more in the public domain in a sense but the Paige stuff is out there as well. What exactly is the difference?\\n\\nAside from the whole Chyna chose to do porn and Paige had pictures leaked difference.  Ye having a good night?

The only part of it I have ever heard was that he wanted to bring in Bryan Danielson and push him as a submission monster, en route to an epic confrontation with Kurt Angle.  It\\'d be fun if a one-named wrestler in WWE changed their name to all caps. \\n\\nRUSEV.\\n\\nCESARO.\\n\\nELIAS. It is only a 200-page book. That might be why they find it expensive. From his wiki page, he was diagnosed the following month after this happened The sendoff was when he hit Roman with it to win the title. Exactly, you basically just proved him right in that one response... They didn\\'t ban kicks to the head tho. Just one move in this case. He\\'s a good wrestler, he should be able to overcome it and he has. That goes for anyone with a banned move. This is the biggest stage, adapt or move out of the way for those who will. Stupid mark is stupid mark.\\n\\nNobody is a misogynist for wanting the career of an unprofessional piece of shit, who betrayed the trust of a fellow professional and intentionally injured her. They don\\'t care about her being a woman. Fuck, they are speaking out in defence of another woman. They want her gone for the safety of other workers she could work with, most of which will be women, because she is not to be trusted\\n\\n\\nWhy has there always got to be some daft Democrat or Republican who has to talk shite, even in wrestling threads? FUCK CIAMPA Give me a ten minute orchestral Glorious Domination damnit He achieved it. There were plenty of other promotions vying for the spot; besides ECW, there was Smoky Mountain and AWF, plus AAA trying to make inroads into America and the remnants of the NWA. And frankly, ECW probably had more brand recognition as #3 than TNA has ever had as #2.  [I would easily buy five of these hats, when it comes to merchandise Ric just get it.](https://ricflairshop.com/collections/frontpage/products/wheelin-n-dealin-hat) \\n\\nIf you\\'re gonna do it, do it with Flair. That\\'s probably the main difference. Chyna chose to do porn and was continuing to make that choice. If she\\'d have lived longer, she\\'d probably have ended up in a very different place eventually. \\n\\nAt that point, a hall of fame initiation would have started looking likely again. A speech that talks about those times and ends with talk about her more recent charity work or whatever it would have been is a lot easier to stomach for the corporate side than a hall of fame speech that ends with her *promoting her latest DVD.* \\n\\nWhatever else might be going on with Paige, it\\'s a world of difference between starring in actual porn and having intimate and embarrassing files leaked and/or stolen.  You know, it\\'s disappointing that Corbin was the only one to speak out against this. Instead of letting a clown who\\'s paid to disregard CTE speak I thought part of his gimmick was that there\\'s literally some sort of demon inside of him that manifests within the facepaint? lol As in that\\'s the point of his need to express that \"monster\" side. i figured greet ya wee rat meant masterbating I hate when people try to downplay 2011-13 Punk with \"HE JUST CUTS FAKE SHOOT PROMOZ!!1!\" shit. No. He doesn\\'t. He cut realistic promos. There were never, ever any \"shoot\" comments. Mentioning the politics involved in wrestling isn\\'t cheap and it\\'s not breaking kayfabe. It only makes sense that even in kayfabe world that there would be politics, and that people would have to manufacture all these dumb catchphrases and styles/gimmicks in order to get pushed by the machine. In the fake world of wrestling, why would Dan Severn not just destroy Stone Cold? Why wasn\\'t he getting shots at him? Cause hes boring and the machine would never get behind someone like that. It makes total sense and people who parrot this nonsense about Punks promos being cheap fake shoots aren\\'t thinking clearly.\\n\\nAlso, even worse is \"HE ONLY GOT OVER CAUSE HE DID THOSE PROMOS ANYONE COULD DO IT\". Bullshit. If anyone could, why didn\\'t they?  That Nikki Bella heel turn stole the show Sad Bobby Roode. He said this was his favourite weigh-in on that impromptu AMA the other day. Please tell me where you found this out, this is too interesting to let me ignore. Did he say this on the MMA hour with Helwani or somewhere else? &gt;[**Seth Rollins Talks About Randy Orton Greatest RKO In All Time [3:22]**](http://youtu.be/naqsVBf-tSA)\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Randy Orton RKO on Seth Rolins at Wrestlemania 31 .Seth discussed how they came up with idea\\n\\n&gt; [*^Steel ^Chair*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmWLxMb8DllhxhjRseSgddg) ^in ^Entertainment\\n\\n&gt;*^234 ^views ^since ^Dec ^2016*\\n\\n[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) And for only 9.99 Tell someone to leave the long haired superfan alone A heel \"body positivity\" stable of Mark Henry, Nia Jax and Big Show who go around beating up Finn Balor and critiquing his diet and fitness regimen.

I\\'m not sure what he was doing with that but my gut feeling tells me it was either a marketing thing to get people interested in GFW or that, plus an early down payment to GFW content as an early access kind of thing.\\n\\nI guess similar to when I paid over £100 each to Devin Townsend and one of Tank Girl\\'s co-creators, respectively.

Dean was/is super close with both Seth and Roman I believe, and Seth and Roman only started to click with each other as of last year. if we aren\\'t getting becky vs charlotte for the title at mania then this system is really corrupt.  I wonder what his pops thinks. Desmond Xavier doing GFW proud.......he\\'s one to watch for going forward......I can\\'t wait for him to have a decent X Division run \\n\\nOn another note I bet the amount of Swamp ass smelt absolutely terrible as it does with all PWG shows I said he was a cross between The Rock and Chris Elliott.  Imagine this happened on raw/smackdown in 2017 They weigh less, they don\\'t need to be sitting in big ~~dawg~~ boy chairs /s The worst thing is that this \"foreign national pride\" is actually not that common. That\\'s why these promos feel like they are being written by a middle aged american, because most bulgarians are probably not as patriotic as that. \\n\\nIf someone would cut a John Cena style murica promo in germany he would get very uncomfortable silence and awkward stares. \\n\\nPatriotism has a really bad stigma in europe since we have all been around longer and had more time doing stupid things in the name of our countries. Problem is they haven\\'t created any other stars outside of Bliss, who has done more damage than good.  So what? Only unestablished wrestlers should win titles now? That\\'s how you get Jinder as WWE Champion and how unimpressive he\\'s been at literally everything he\\'s done since winning the title. Yeah I dont really think that he is gone, or he would not have got his shirt in Hot Topics just 2 weeks ago... meh WWE should bring back unique sets for PPVs.  Job out Bray Wyatt to a returning Boogeyman. Did anyone else see Dale Earnhardt Jr. posting in the comments? Roman could definitely pick a couple of heels without it looking strange, Cena maybe not so much, he\\'s probably the one that needs to stick with an all face team.  It would work as long as they continue to book it as \"devastating\" as the others you mentioned not too often someone kicks out of the Pop-up powerbomb and the Jacknife usually signaled the end of the match can only remember HHH kicking out of it once not sure of any others.

Well, they did have Elias Samson doing his \"Drifter\" schtick, walking in the crowd on the hard camera shots, for a few weeks when he first came up. I know. Its a good thing so we can have more competition in the division than just 4 women\\n\\nthe horsewomen dont need titles. That just kills the division if you only push 4 women Depressingly fair point Why does Sasha look Indian in this picture?  Just needed to wrap his legs for a solid guillotine. Nothing comes close  I try to do the same thing when I play booking games and its great to see this happen in real life. Sami Zayns helluva kick usually looks very good. Amen. I\\'d be less likely to miss a raw or ppv if i thought i had a solid chance of one of charlotte\\'s sloppy pepperonis popping out or seeing some of the boss\\'s beaver cleavage. I still remember clearly the moment steph let that mcmahon melon swing free one of the greatest moments in pro wrestling history  Becky/Charlotte or Rollins/Dean. Which is the better couple? I was listening to a podcast today and it was like someone in the industry and they were so complimentary of her i was like do they know  Goldberg beat him in 84 seconds. Plus it was goldberg who was only there for a short time. He didn\\'t squash Cena or Dean or Seth. Hard enough that roh doesn\\'t unless you add all the random stations and separate days. Hell roh didn\\'t even come close to them when they were showed directly after tna on DA swing and a miss IF it\\'ll be a singles feud and not a triple threat with Sasha, which in that case Sasha is obviously the face, I see Nia as the face and Alexa as the heel. Alexa is too good at being a heel and Nia can easily be the loveable, cracking jokes/throwing shade, \"big\" wrestler, think Big Show.  That basically happened at SummerSlam when he was arguing with Kurt Angle I don\\'t care about technicalities or schedules.\\n\\nWherever Nakamura is, that\\'s where Graves should be. The Kinshasa doesn\\'t have the same effect as when Graves screams it at the top of his lungs. I would like to see Jinder Mahal without any championship. Or in any matches, really. Im not. Im saying why does sasha need a title reign, when there are other women who need the rub to establish themselves as players of the division when sasha was in the title picture from january 2016 til about april 2017 When he does appear in the ring again; they should have him spout off about staring death in the face and walking away and then suddenly have the arena go dark....\\n\\n\\nBong! The vast amount of negative PR about this is from the Hardys and people jumping on the Hardys\\' bandwagon. Anthem made very few public statements about this and answered questions in interviews, none of their response was disproportionate to the issue, and all of it occurred well after people were responding to their silence by shitting on them regardless. I get that everyone\\'s decided they\\'re the bad guys, but it requires selective vision to suggest that the Hardy issue comprises the bulk or even a significant amount of Anthem\\'s PR and marketing.

Agreed. NJPWWorld is the only thing that\\'s worth $10 a month for me. WWE Network is worth $10 SOMETIMES. GFW isn\\'t getting more than $5 from me. What about Santino? I\\'m still scared of that snake.  &gt; These Anti American gimmicks are always crap\\n\\nAnd so outdated. I get WWE is an American company first, but with it being an international product too there are so many of us who couldn\\'t give a flying fuck about the American hero overcoming the odds and preserving his country\\'s honour *cough Flag Match cough*  \\n  \\nIt\\'s just an easy, and perhaps lazy, way to give two wrestlers beef with one another Nice to see Being The Elite joining the world of 60fps videos. I think Alexa is going to be the face she\\'s already worked programs with Sasha and Bailey unless I\\'m missing something the rest of the raw women are heel I\\'m actually surprised this was so easy for me to read. A lot Probably the best designed BC shirt  Who gives them shit?!  Make a joint streaming service with NOAH and I\\'ll be interested. What show is this and how do I watch? I keep hearing good things about current CMLL Isn\\'t it the \"Eat Defeat\"? THeir feud isn\\'t over yet - I\\'m sure there\\'s more to come. It seems so intimidating to get into if you weren\\'t in early.  Isn\\'t the manga still ongoing? I\\'d like to see Sami Zayn involved in the US title scene. Sami vs AJ for that title would be pretty damn great, the matches those two would have together  would most likely be amazing. I heard yesterday that 48%of Seth\\'s matches have involved Dean in some way, 25%of deans have involved Seth (deans had over 500 more WWE matches than seth) Actually, [it was The Miz](https://youtu.be/HgoUjlixPII)  I\\'m not American.\\n\\nNHS currently - but it\\'s a window into the bleak hell that will be the future of the UK Yup it was in a stretcher match against RVD if I\\'m not mistaken. Went for the springboard moonsault and pretty much landed directly on his shin on the guardrail, some awkwardness followed where you could see RVD not really knowing what to do...and a few minutes later Sabu got up and finished the match. Not the NFL! Those people are just being pussies! Fuck the Revival It\\'s an awesome design. Wish there was an easy way to get it in the UK. Heard some bad things about ProWrestlingTees shipping over here. May he remain the dirtiest player in the game for many more years to come. Old age You have a problem with fancy socks, coffee and fishing? seriously though, check out his instagram. Yeah Who was saying she needed the title? I personally would like to see her have a relatively lengthy run with the title but I didn\\'t say anything about her needing to be champion. Plus if she is champion, isn\\'t that a way of giving a rub to the unestablished women by being in a feud with and possibly beating her for the title? Destination America. The network they were both on about  a year ago  He looks very relieved once he\\'s landed that  This is my favourite match of all time. The story in this match was absolutely incredible. I\\'ll never forget that ending, Brock about to put Punk down and Punk still scrambling to get at Heyman.\\n\\nIt was so much more brutal and physical than other Punk matches, and was a reminder of how good Lesnar was when he was against a capable opponent. It\\'s so frustrating now, watching him suplex endlessly when he has all the ability in the world up his sleeve.\\n\\nDefinite 5 star match.  I mean, if you\\'ve only ever watched modern WWE I\\'m sure Omega/Okada looked like hardcore wrestling  I didn\\'t read the fake report but I will say this. Given how quickly they tried to distance themselves from making that terrible new Emma theme, regardless of the reason (twitter backlash, etc) I could see why someone might speculate them being on their way out. If it was honest, it\\'d be the greatest movie of all time. Lawler took a hell of a bump  You can\\'t blame America on Ric Flair\\'s bad spending habit. He was once NWA\\'s highest paid star. His medical bills could\\'ve been paid easily. Also, I\\'m sure he\\'s still signed to WWE, he can afford it. Look at how sweaty he is. I know everyone was sweating buckets cuz the capacity was twice the limit, but he reached Lesnar levels of sweat there.  James and Dana? The salt towards these two feuding is hilarious. EUGENE  Ric Flair\\'s heart had him in a figure-four leglock, but he reversed the pressure. \"I GOT BACK TAXES AND MEDICAL BILLS, I NEED THIS JOB\" Just speaks to how versatile AJ is to even have this discussion. Both feuds for the ages.  Are you trying to say Tonky was a bad champ? The NBA, huh?\\n\\nIt all boils down to poor decision making.  Are they faces? I only get the Hulu version and I cant tell you the last time either of them made the 90minute version Bullishit, not even you think thats true a lot of people especially due to them just ripping off  other songs to create the themes. they\\'re the modern day Jimmy Hart &amp; Howard Helm Every woman in the 80s did it with Flair. Because people just want to see the horsewomen win everything and be involved in everything. Legit i see everyone saying they want women to succeed but it seems like they just want the horsewomen too I\\'m a Scot so reading that was like reading clean English to me but holy shit, you\\'re totally right that\\'s hilarious. I think either Jim Cornette or Brian Last said it the best on this weeks podcast. \"She is neither sexy nor a star.\" Let Asuka come up, unify the titles, end the brand split and give the women their own show.  Calling Pete pretentious. One look at the development of Who\\'s Next was all I needed to figure out that guy was nuts. Also, who the fuck decides to sing lead vocals on ANY song when you have Roger god damn Daultrey in your band? A pretentious twat, that\\'s who. I love how he gets Rogan to play along each time  Better be careful about enjoying Cody around these parts  Well I didn\\'t say anything like that but yeah I do see that as well sometimes. At least when it comes to those hardcore death match types they are told multiple times they don\\'t **have** to do it, CZW being the best about it, theirs they used to (don\\'t know if they still do or not) still pay the wrestlers even if they backed out of the death match, they knew they couldn\\'t pay them a big amount so they didn\\'t want them to ruin their body if they didn\\'t feel comfortable with it.\\n\\nThis spot though served no purpose what so ever. Wait so the wwe brought someone back from the dead and channel him into nxt.\\n\\nOne person associated with nxt is known to to be an expert in shovel handling.\\n\\nEverything makes sense, bruce willis was dead the whole time.\\n As much as a sound can be, that shit is burned into my soul. Her Looks Help. TBH me personally, I\\'m not an Alexa Bliss fan...I was, but she cuts the same promo every week, she has become stale, her in-ring work doesn\\'t do anything for me and im not invested in her. ATM, i personally prefer Nia and i hope they put the title on her. I know i might get heat from the Alexa fanboys but she doesn\\'t do anything for me... Is she over, well yes, but let\\'s be honest, 70% of anyone in the building wants to have sex with her. I didn\\'t know what he looked like until now but I loved him in Snatch. Knew him from MMA fame didn\\'t he he had moved to pro wrestling for real  What I love is that he\\'s slyly put himself into almost the most important position (with the best perspective of crowd-feel) he can be in, without being a wrestler ... because where better to be than the right-hand man of your Ace of the company, who\\'s probably going to be so for most of the next decade.  He gets to monitor the progress of his top guy from ringside and even control subtle things like getting the claps going at the right time in the match to build the atmosphere and make the matches of the top guy feel like a bigger deal.  He basically gets to be a conductor in the most important matches. This post was removed for being re-hosted content.

Marty Scurll using the power of The World i see.  I like Finn, don\\'t love him, but im a fan. They\\'ve done nothing interesting with him since he returned and fans can be fickle so that\\'s why some are complaining about him Haha I actually might This was called the [\"Bunkhouse Stampede\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyndj0nPdRw).\\n\\nGood idea on paper, but it was boring as hell in execution. Too many people in the ring, so they couldn\\'t do anything and the eliminations weren\\'t exciting at all.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a version of this that CMLL does where the goal is to not be the last people in the cage. It suffers from a lot of the same problems. Wooooo My bad. I thought it said biopic. Same thought process still applies though. Even that this story is false and as much as I like CFO$ at the moment, I like that WWE is still giving Jim Johnston some themes to do. For instance, Baron Corbin\\'s new theme is a Johnston work, which I didn\\'t realize \\'til I actually looked at the artist listing. Please do, I\\'m actually curious to see if you can. Haven\\'t bought tickets yet. Gonna get decent seats but nothing too wild It\\'s amazing how Goldust is in better shape now than he was in his prime.  Well it wasn\\'t a traveling channel, and that just shows your ignorance. The biggest network and only national network roh has ever been on and you feign ignorance. They got were put on right after tna and had abysmal ratings  Yeah its a shame people literally want to see them fall flat on their face and do bad. I hope they fuckin have an amazing match and shut all the haters up This, exactly. I\\'ll Explain what he was in NXT because they\\'ve done nothing on main. He is a nice guy who is great in ring, but when people piss him off, he has a dark side, and that\\'s the demon. When he was feuding with Joe, he was a guy who wanted to represent NXT but Joe wanted to justify his move to NXT, so he targeted Finn and Finn had to bring out the demon as Joe was larger. Hope that made a lick of sense YOU KNOW, IVE WRESTLED ALOT OF HOUSES. 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Was my theory ever looked into ? Only one member of each non-American nationality may be represented! We don\\'t want our fans to have to *think* too much, do we?  You act as if 300k weekly viewers isn\\'t a big deal... I preferred the other sound alike of Black Cat by Janet Jackson.  Suzuki should\\'ve played Josuke in the live action JoJo movie Getting clean will do that to you. \"Witch doctery bullshit\", in Punk\\'s words. I think you mean 6 months pregnant.  I hope you mean that, anyway Kind of hindered by constant  talent raids, don\\'t you think? Which is stupid, since JJ did the same thing. &gt; If you already work 40 hours per week, would you be happy to work 42 every week?\\n\\nFor nearly double the money?  Yes, absolutely.  Anyone would. So in other words ITS NOT SOME MAGIC TICKET TO GET OUT OF THE MIDCARD?\\n\\n\\n Yep, to a \"T\". I\\'m shocked GLOW hasn\\'t commented on the similarities, to be honest. \\n\\nFuck, WWE might as well complete the set and sign Lacey and put her in a program against Lana\\'s evil Russian. YEAH! Ric is the best! Sting vs. Rollins. \\n\\nFinn vs. Rollins.  People call it a circlejerk, they can call it whatever they want.. If people change their opinions, theres nothing wrong with that\\n\\nYou are allowed to be a fan of something you once hated or disliked\\n\\nI hated njpw and thought they fucking sucked but i never watched it. Til i actually watched it and now its my favorite wrestling company  Meltzdrones downvoting this will never not be funny.  The guy who conducted the interview has a vendetta against KO, he literally gets everyone he interviews to rip on him What the fuck. Just keep going with it. Vince rapes Sasha and when he can\\'t perform she loses her push because he blames her. That\\'s what you meant, right?  On one side you  have for the most part relatively young talent with promise and upsides on the other hand you have washed up guys who couldn\\'t get over or are no longer over.. Yep just wwe  marks being wwe marks  They pay us to watch right? Does Chikara not own the building? It amazes me how many people who visit this subreddit still think the \"pipebomb\" was actually real. Not if he lived in Europe  The Bucks and Kenny Omega do that all the time with the Elite. They incorporated Nick Jackson\\'s real life food poisoning into the reason they kicked Adam Cole out of the Bullet Club, and it was all on their Being the Elite channel But in a mask. So they never knew it was Sami who screwed Shane over. \"Big if true\"  Why not make it even more Russo-esque and have everyone start outside the cell. First one INTO the cell wins. Man what? You literally proved my point, everyone says bayley doesnt deserve to get booed because she was injured yet no one said shit when cena put over daniel bryan clean and announced he needed surgery and taking time off &gt;Reality is every single person here knowing that the main event was more about Rock vs Cena than it was about Miz vs Cena. \\n\\nthis sub is not reflective of wrestling fans or WWE fans My two favourites are R-Evolution and Brooklyn 1 so it\\'s a toss up between those two for me. Sad Goldust? So because I say I\\'m not going to hold your hand and guide you like a child by explaining something for you that\\'s presented to you on a TV show means I don\\'t know it? I\\'m not here to baby you, that\\'s on you if you can\\'t figure out something that\\'s directly spoon fed to you.  Worth it.  \"having a great match\" and \"having a top 100-of-all-time match\" aren\\'t the same or even close but i can appreciate someone that knows they\\'re wrong and moves the goalposts :~) Creative taking control over broken Matt Hardy gimmick and water it down to appeal to kids. It\\'s almost like they should push the best wrestlers if they want women\\'s wrestling to be taken seriously I still think Takeover: R-Evolution has the best main event in NXT history this far but Takeover: Brooklyn (the first one) is probably the best overall show they\\'ve produced.  You\\'re allowed your opinion, u/BoringCorbin..\\n\\nI like Finn too. I find Emma boring, but everyone on here loves her. Different people have different tastes and that\\'s totally okay.  Even though the matches are super easy to win? Every SVR2011 match I had lasted under 2 minutes. Io vs Sasha\\n\\nIo vs Bayley\\n\\nIo vs Charlotte\\n\\nIo vs Becky Lynch\\n\\nIo vs Alexa\\n\\nIo vs Nia\\n\\nIo vs everyone else\\n\\nOh, Mayu vs Sasha That\\'s an awesome team! *When I mean i get that but he does have his reasons and his corporate sponsors, worst booker is definitely a stretch when you consider he runs the biggest wrestling company in the world and turns a profit year in and year out GFW/Impact mark lmfao\\nTheyve been struggling to put asses in seats, no way its doing 1100 I\\'d guess it was either in first two or the second two.

That\\'s funny That\\'s a conversation you need to have with your HR department.  Also, $5500 seems to be a very high out of pocket max with the ACA in effect.  He\\'s had lots of good matches but he\\'s never pushed it into that upper echelon and had a really great match. I\\'m not moving goalposts. He\\'s never had a truly brilliant match that people would put on a top 10, 100, 1000 whatever list. Who\\'s favourite match of all time is a Miz match? Nobody.  Then he rolled death up. Grab the trucks and won the match. It\\'s my wife\\'s job. But I\\'m sure her HR will let her have a better plan than anyone else.

But afterward you\\'re going to be in excruciating pain. We\\'ll just do that every match. So I did that in trials and at the Olympics.\"\\n\\nSounds horrific actually. Yeah, the quieter Da\\' slow down, your heart!

MFW BTE is slowly introducing members\\' superpowers that will somehow eventually be used to combat the WWE stooge in an Avengers-esque special episode. There\\'s a series that\\'s been done (possible still is) that highlights the absolute worst. It\\'s called \"Wtf WCW\" (I think) on this sub.  Pretty much anyone who has worked with him and been interviewed says he is a wrestling genius but a horrible business man...but I\\'ll take the word of a random redditor instead.\\n\\nHeyman ain\\'t sh*t. I bet your fantasy booking and Shield fan fiction on Tumblr would crush anything Heyman has ever done Sadly, the IWC exists as a hivemind, with people constantly jumping on whatever the mobs opinion is so they can seem edgy or cool. Like what you like, and if you start to like something or someone less, that\\'s cool. Just don\\'t form your opinions around the hivemind. It\\'s denziens are legion here on SC. It must be awesome to be so close with some of the wrestlers that they tell you how they feel about winning belts.  This is so weird to me.  Grew up hearing Schiavone on comms and now he\\'s praising The Miz.  I don\\'t know why but it seems so bizarre.  Maybe it\\'s that Miz seems so polar opposite to WCW? \"*Aw chur bro yeah nah just wanna shout out to all the south side bros and bro-esses especially Vinny and Britenay, yeah nah they\\'re the fuckin boiz aye bro yeah nah chur. I need me an L&amp;P and a pie now. Chur*\" Personally for me his greatest achievement in life is marrying Maryse. Everything else is the cherry on the top. \\n\\nMiz and Maryse have awesome chemistry together, they were really made for each other. Takeover Orlando is super underrated. WOOO! A Miz/Eli promo would be orgasmic. Meh. Not super interested in a Vince biography. An autobiography however would be fucking fascinating.  /r/scottishpeopletwitter *DING!!!* About as bad as the first stage of the Punjabi Prison match was. Not to mention it just gives the terrible writing team at WWE more chances to insult the fans intelligence by ignoring the pre-established rules, and over booking the thing to death. So for the most part, it will be like everything the WWE does nowadays, awful (NXT of course, is excluded from that.). I hate Kenny King and I don\\'t know exactly why Nah, it\\'s not good at all. Only 30 ppl out of the millions (...and millions!) of viewers remember it. *Nerds*, what can you do! \\n\\nHave an upvote, good brother! Sandow. Charlie Haas.  I love how when Hangman disappears Marty looks in a sunglasses case. I mean, if Jinder Mahal was beating people up backstage,  ripping doors off, flipping ambulances, throwing people like dolls, id be behind Jinder 100%.  I was crying on and off all night this night as it was something truly magical. It was the first time in my life something that I believed was dead was revived 100% in front of my eyes. And as soon as I heard the first few notes of Enter Sandman I immediately lost it and started balling. I pounded 4 16 ounce beers before he hit the written. I\\'m saying that the HR department needs to negotiatate better for the entire company.  Not just a special plan for her.  His podcast is so fuckin good Tacking onto your part about Orangus Bungholus:\\n\\nDonald Trump required directors and producers to write him into a good deal of his movies as a condition of shooting in/around Trump tower.\\n\\nIn New York, his reputation has been that of a bullying shitbird for decades.  If they do an Asian tournament maybe they could giver her the title for one night in Chyna . September of what year? I admire your faith in ol\\' double j, but to me and the pussies who downvoted you (unnecessarily so) it seems like phoney carney bullshit from a 3rd generation guy, well versed in working the marks and phoney carney bullshit. He looks 85 but at least he\\'s alive.  Woooo, spicy! Woooo, tangy! At the time I didn\\'t even really care. I just had so much fun with all the weapons physics and everything. Chett Chetterfield should replace him.  WCW Saturday Night I\\'d rather have Kharma back as the Welfare Queen. The main one was wcw Saturday night also had a one hour morning show called worldwide that\\'s where I first saw hhh debut At the moment, nobody. Villain vs villain can happen. Plus, WWE is doing more grey area jazz. I imagine Nia will be the one to lean towards being a hero, but she will still be a villain at the end of the day. If you enjoyed his first two definitely read the third.  This is false and nothing but a bad assumption many often make without any evidence. People change their opinions when new stuff happens. Oftentimes, the same reason one person changes their opinion is the same reason many others do. That\\'s not bandwagon jumping or hive mind, it\\'s simply new information or changing circumstances effecting opinions in mass.  Hey, at the end of the day it\\'s just his opinion, shouldn\\'t be downvoted for it Goldust had a seminar about wrestling that he held for rookies as Dustin Rhodes. He\\'s eloquent and easy to listen to. He\\'s quite informative and knowledgeable as well late \\'96, early \\'97 It goes both ways, too. I see a lot of comments like, \"Since when did everyone start liking ______ around here?\" like it\\'s a bad thing. It\\'s okay for people to not like a certain person for whatever reason, then change their mind about them later on. \"How am I supposed to tranquilo at this?\" the ref. he will count the pin and end the Nia Jax match and that will make him over with me. **FIX IT** gimmick confirmed. big EEEEEEEEEE Or we could get the INDEED voiceover guy again! Man he is starting to really look old.  It\\'s hard to see one of your idols looking so vulnerable  I thought they would go somewhere with the \"Darren awkwardly stares at his hands\" moment, like he suddenly becomes a super powerhouse and submits everyone with the crossface chickenwing, goes on to win a midcard title.  \\n\\nWas actually a bit disappointed when that led to nothing.  you’re not even getting it right lol it’s Plumpy\\n\\n\\nedit; not like it matters but here’s the comments he deleted\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0rXXy Hosted.  He shut it down.  I know this because I clicked the link you shared. I would like to see Finn back in New Japan, since he is wasted in WWE, same with Nakumura, as they refuse to put him in a match with someone who can mesh with his style (even though there are guys on the roster that can like KO, AJ and several others.) \\n\\nI\\'d like to see Miz retired.  What is Steve Corino doing? They did sign him, right? Or is he an agent or something. Made me smile to see him up and at \\'em. Get better, Ric! Miz needs more intimidating bodyguards. Blake and Murphy would be better. Destination America isn\\'t a Traveling channel.. it\\'s a ghost channel... 90% of their shows have the world Ghost in them. I hope not. I love Juicy but I don’t think he’s right for the title. Jonah carries the belt well.  9 but one will be 500+ days to wipe Punks record of Longest Modern Day WWE Champion. I noticed that too. And that this appeared to be filmed with him sitting down. He still have a long way to go.  Cody: \"I\\'m gonna stretch him\"\\n\\noh no... no no no no...  This the tag titles would dilute the division too much but the secondary title allows you to move the talent up and down the card better ie getting alexa out of the picture when Asuka comes in and right now it would bring so much value to the emma stuff giving her feuds with mickie, dana eventually dropping it to paige in a return that may or may not happen with a built in story about the revolution. There are many people that change their opinions for there own reasons. There are many more that do so for the reasons I listed above. Take a course in psychology or sociology, this is basic stuff. The IWC is definitely a hivemind that sanctions those who disagree with it.  It\\'s also the only work-shoot promo of the week. I think his career floundered because he concussed Ziggler and made Barrett have to get shoulder surgery because dude couldn\\'t control his strength and laid shit in too heavy. do you have a source that says they constantly sell out 1000 seats per venue? No. He said he didn\\'t tell anyone until after he was already there. Kinda shitty given how many other people could have had a shot. HOWEVER, if he truly gets his shit together, this will be a ridiculously great comeback story for WWE and his character to use to get him over. I don\\'t mean that sarcastically, he wasn\\'t really getting over, but some of WWEs best story lines have taken real life problems and put them in a story.  He\\'ll channel his inner Shibata.\\n\\n\"I am alive. That\\'s all\" The forearm is pretty much his primary finisher Rugby is still the only sport where they have clear cut concussion protocol that is in the hands of a neutral party. \\n\\nSo for top flight rugby matches(tier 1 nations-England, NZ, RSA, Australia, France, Argentina, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) all players have monitor patches on their backs. Among other things this tracks speed, area covered etc. It also tracks impact. So coaches and officials can see in real time how much force players are taking in tackles and scrums and rucks. So coaches have a good idea on when a player needs to be pulled. Refs also have to usher any play suspected of a head injury off the field for assessment. \\n\\nNow the way they keep this good is that you sub a player out use the HIR(Head Injury Replacement. similar to how rugby also uses blood subs.) where you can temporarily sub a player in, have the injured player off for assessment, then decide if the sub needs to be kept on or reverted. \\n\\nThis way you keep injured players happy, because if they pass protocol they can return, you keep players safe, because the decision to assess a player is in the hands of the match official, and the assessment is done by a neutral party. combined with the real time data, you can actually see evidence rather than relying on a test like SCAT.  I\\'m with Hangman, Nandos is shite  This has gone too far. First the WWE brings back the dead and now they\\'ve kidnapped Hangman Page?! They already have content on FITE, dont? I think so too and I\\'m not sure why you think that somehow disproves what I said.  how do you like it so far, similar to his 3rd? can\\'t wait to pick it up.  YOSHI-HASHI is the same. Interestingly, when those wrestlers names are shown at the beginning of a New Japan match, they aren\\'t presented in Japanese like guys with regular names. thanks!  whole new facet of lucha libre i knew nothing about! This is pre-match vignette bro; not a promo. Big show Good. Honestly CFO$ are incredibly talented. I have been constantly surprised at the repeated quality of their tracks and how much they can help elevate a character. The first time Finn Balor came out as the demon to their song... I showed that to every single friend I knew including people that dont watch wrestling. It was one of those when wrestling is good it can be really special moments. They should be given a chance at every major character that comes through WWE. Harsh but dead on.  Breeze vs Brock in a \"How Long Until Breeze Dies\" match This is so awesome. 9/25/2000\\n\\nSteve Austin returns after being out nearly a year with a reoccurring neck injury. Rhea Ripley , I\\'d like her to , respectfully, sit on my face. He wasn\\'t completely in charge on SD. Well he was head writer per se but even Pritchard confirmed that they all had equal say on both shows. Heyman had just as much say on SmackDown as he did on Raw. It was a joint creative process oversaw by Steph.  Honestly in terms of resells on eBay and WWE shop she is probably number 1. Close to Sasha. In terms of pops and crowd reaction she is top 4  I\\'m no book expert, but 10$ is expensive? He looks very old for only 68. Not sure if the cancer drugs or doing roids for 30+ years. I am slightly upset at the lack of \"son of a gun\" hat. I think Chicago was the best. I don\\'t doubt that for at least a little bit PWG could fill a 1000 seat venue--maybe even twice that for a big show--but they obviously don\\'t want to do that for their own reasons. He doesn\\'t have any talent or charisma in the ring or in the booth... Yeah, if they get NOAH and AAA on here, I\\'d definitely subscribe. Perry SATURN. \\n\\nVal VENIS\\n\\nJoey MERCURY Those fucking tag matches though. Wow the belt is looking so beat up  The hate for Cena was so strong that the mere thought of Roman becoming a Cena 2.0 got him more hate before it even began. They don\\'t \"sell out\" it\\'s free. Try going to the show like I have multiple times. Once it fills you gotta stand outside and wait for people to leave.\\n\\nThe burden of proof to prove otherwise is on you. You\\'re the one claiming it doesn\\'t happen &gt; they\\'re more than capable of putting good matches and strong performances.\\n\\nYa, with better wrestlers than them Sounds like someone hasn\\'t had their daily bowl of Booty-Os Jonah Rock forever! CMLL has like 3 weekly shows on youtube. Not sure which one is this but the cards are in the descriptions. \\n\\nTheir channel:https://www.youtube.com/user/VideosOficialesCMLL * Kalisto and Alicia Fox\\n\\n* Sami Zayn and Charlotte\\n\\n* Kevin Owens and Gran Metalik &gt; should of \\n\\n Did you mean should have? \\n\\n-------------------------------------- \\nThis is a bot account. What language is that? dean ambrose is banging renee I think Maybe she should keep her mouth shut and stop \"shooting\" about WWE creative and booking. They are probably hesitant to give her a long title run because they don\\'t trust her to do media. I remember seeing him do a few things in his first year that gave me pause like... Whoa, maybe he\\'s better than I\\'m expecting, but it took him forever to really start to get it. Looking for a ticket for night 2. I\\'m at American legion hall now and willing to pay a generous premium for an extra ticket  Woods is the next Hulk Hogan confirmed? Ah, I misunderstood ya. Thought you meant when RAW officially went to TNN. My fault. Also, I didn\\'t realize it took TNN that long to rebrand to Spike TV. Thought it was a year earlier than that but you\\'re correct. So did Smoky Mountain, NWA, and AAA at various points. So does Evolve now.  Watch those early NXTs with Corey on commentary. It took him at least a good 6 months to start even approaching the Heenan/Ventura level he\\'s at now. Wasn\\'t Final Deletion almost universally liked? They put a good match in the past though in nxt. Bliss vs Nia vs Carmella. It\\'s on wwe youtube. not creepy at all Didn\\'t you make a post a couple days ago saying you were happy Alexa won? I think they only added Nitro\\'s and ppvs to the network. Maybe try terra rizing debut wcw in google he debuted with few squash wins worked a short feud with Larry Zysbisco then jobbed till he left his theme music I thought was awesome I was also like 14 not sure how much I\\'d like it now lol [You\\'re a Jackass](https://media.giphy.com/media/26ni7paLa4PZIPVbG/giphy.gif)\\n\\n\\n\\nFFS man watch MITB and see who the crowd is chanting for. DO you watch the product?  They rebranded twice, new TNN too, though I can\\'t seem to find the date for that but I know was 02. But yeah looking through pages, that was the date I found, also found July 7, 2003 but don\\'t think the change was made yet then on TV.  WHAT\\'S /u/dacost92 DOING IN THE IMPACT ZONE?!  &gt;Yeah and I love it. It\\'s forbidden to mention Vince at all during the Hall of Fame because he wants the weekend to be about the talent and not about the man behind the scenes.\\n\\n\\nThis gets parroted often but I don\\'t buy it for a second. Vince is the most egotistical guy in the company, he\\'d want nothing more than getting topped off by every single person he puts up there on stage.  What this really is about is how it would play when some wrestlers would and others wouldn\\'t.  Some would mean it, others would bullshit through it and we\\'d all know. He doesn\\'t want wrestlers telling stories that would paint him in a negative light.  It\\'s cool to hear about the \"boys being boys\" but you can\\'t do that to Vince. \\n\\n He had no indy background, went from  RW to developmental.  Smarks then say \"Oh he\\'s a TV guy, he\\'s gotta be shit.\"  I\\'d like to think that by now, with Miz, Charlotte, Bliss, Roman, etc, that you have enough successes from developmental to appreciate that pathway.  Not everyone from indys/Japan are going to be able to get traction in WWE; just like not everyone WWE trained performer could go to those stages.  But something about the indy trained/\"proven\" performers are the only ones smarks care about.  That needs to change.\\n\\nPS: THat being said, for each Miz, you have a Lucky Cannon, an Eric Escobar, a Ted DiBiase Jr..  It\\'s a tough job to develop talent. They have given her so so so much yet because her reigns don\\'t last more than a month it\\'s sad being a Sasha fan? Sad is being an Emma fan or a Mickie fan or even a Becky fan. Sasha has main evented Raw countless times, she\\'s main evented a PPV, she\\'s been in historic matches, she\\'s on TV every week, she\\'s won 5 titles with the company, she has the most merch out of any woman, she travels the world promoting the brand. But apparently it\\'s sad being a Sasha fan because she can\\'t keep a reign for than a month, which ain\\'t even that bad considering they\\'re even injecting that fact into character which will probably come into play eventually. &gt;she should quit and go to Stardom\\n\\nHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA \\n\\nYeah, except you know, the money is WAY THE FUCK better. \\n\\nDo people on other big time TV shows that draw 3 million viewers every week have fans this stupid that are like \"you know, they should give ___ more of a role, otherwise they should quit and go do some direct-to-dvd show for a few hundred bucks a night\"? Hangman definitely has the WWE look. Won\\'t be surprised to see him there one day. Jericho worked for one night as \"Super Liger\" - intended to be the evil counterpart to Jushin, but things went so badly the gimmick was immediately ditched after the first match. Because CM punk is God to those smark wanna bes r/iamverysmart Even though he didn\\'t win, the fact lesnar asked for heymans help and couldn\\'t beat him clean was kind of surprising. The loss was done well at least. He doesnt. OP is muslim IDK....KO has history with guys that fly around with a mask on.\\n\\n....maybe he has a type? &gt; Emma fan\\n\\nEmma has fans? Could have fooled me by how quite the crowds are for her segments.  It’s-a-me, Mario, and I love lasagna! [Is this true?](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/022/508/C7S0ouqVAAANACj.jpg) Hes been looking weak since WCW I agree she should get a longer reign and it\\'s safe to say that will eventually happen. But let\\'s not pretend like they\\'ve treated her terribly, closing multiple Raws, her and Charlotte being the first women to main event a ppv, first women\\'s iron man and HIAC matches, etc are all pretty damn great accomplishments. Been a rough couple weeks, he\\'s still recovering.  Restore Restore Restore is gonna get over so fucking fast. They should just rename it \"lights out\" and let him have it back. Cole couldn\\'t even fuck that up. Your pants are on fire dude  There\\'s a nice amount of inspiration I\\'m noticing in the women now. I love seeing a show so good actually start to influence the business and bring out some creativity.  So I\\'ve ignored you have I? You said doubt and probably in the first sentence of your comment. In the second sentence of your comment you state \"they just wanted to wait\" not \"they just probably wanted to wait\" you stated that like it was a fact. Besides the fact you think that me not mentioning that is reason enough for you to personally insult tells me exactly what sort of person you are. \\n\\nI called you a child because you called me a retard for no reason. I\\'m not too stupid to understand what you said, what you said was just really stupid. Again though no need to personally insult anyone over it lol. It\\'s a good idea if they don\\'t need to put much money into it. TNA fans are notorious for not spending money on the product. ECW got like 2 grand a month because of Scorpio. That\\'s it. BRAUN Stardust was literally a can of Rockstar.\\n\\nAlso it\\'s funny, I\\'m drinking the white and gold Rockstar right now. This was probably best for all involved. Jericho helped Ambrose get over after that terrible lesnar match and it also had Jericho start to create the gift of Jericho thing and probably made it one of his best years. And Seth vs Roman is much better given the history, especially since dean got involved. That was when he was suspended after an altercation with Dave Lagana (might be someone else). They traced the call back to his parents house but he never admitted it was him. Bruce Prichard spoke in depth about this time on one of recent podcasts. Heyman also told Cena not to do the rap gimmick because it would \"kill his career\" He pushed really hard to Vince to not do the gimmick and Bruce believes Vince went ahead with it purely to piss off Heyman. They need more star vs jobber matches tbh guys like steve blackman &amp; al snow made their bones off these kinds of matches Oh I didn\\'t realise it was only available in the UK. Thanks for the info! buy it and get it signed by both cena and orton. Are you a having a Blissyfit? Well if this doesn\\'t confirm you\\'re a troll, nothing will. What happened to loving Alexa winning the title and preaching the character work is better than wrestling? Does Wreddit have any singers to add lyrics to this? Wow I didn\\'t know that about Cena, probably the biggest thing Heyman has ever been wrong about. Imagine he\\'d listened to Heyman. For her to be champion longer than a month How do we know he\\'d get paid double for it? He may not get paid on that basis. I occasionally hear about Evolve but I never see any clips. What\\'s their deal? 👍\\n\\n2018 is going to be fun.  It\\'s far from perfect, but it would represent the drawing power in a certain demographic, it\\'s not useless I just see a shirt with the name \"randy Orton\" and some stars.  What\\'s wrong? I\\'d enjoy him yelling SUPERKICK anytime someone uses one. Yes but most of the angle beforehand wasn\\'t. I remember people actually being concerned for Matt\\'s mental well-being because they just didn\\'t get it.\\n\\nThe Final Deletion was the turning point, where many got on board. So by your logic they were never successful? Anyone else wish they would just kiss and end the tension? Main event 6 man is going to be a complete spotfests and it\\'s going to be beautiful. Pentagon and Kenny squaring off will probably make Reseda explode. Also can\\'t wait to see the chemistry Kenny and Fenix have  I lied bro I love The Boss Is this an r/scjerk post? He\\'s the most egotistical guy in the company? Said by some guy on the internet who has never met him or anyone else in the company and just believes everything he reads online, am I right? \\n\\nVince, the guy who loaned a bunch of money to Ric Flair out of his own pocket, who let Medusa into the Hall of Fame after she threw his Championship Title in the garbage can on Nitro, who booked himself to get his ass whooped by various people (including his own son at Mania 17), who booked himself to kiss Big Show\\'s sweaty ass on a random RAW....THIS is the guy who has the biggest ego in the company? \\n\\nIf we\\'re going to make character judgments about people we\\'ve never met, I\\'ll one-up you and say Triple H\\'s ego is 100 times that of his father-in-law\\'s. Between the backstage politicking, the waiting three hours to pin Booker T at Wrestlemania in a match he had no business winning and even his work in NXT (which one could argue he only does just so he can prove to everyone he can run a promotion just as well as Vince). \\n\\nIf Vince carried about getting blown by everyone on stage, why wouldn\\'t he just make the policy \"make sure to mention me, but only say good shit\" instead of \"don\\'t mention me at all\"? Your argument is not logically sound **Here\\'s a sneak peek of /r/SCJerk using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/SCJerk/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) of all time!**\\n\\n\\\\#1: [I performed Cesaro\\'s pipebomb for my drama class today.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SCJerk/comments/4ts4t3/i_performed_cesaros_pipebomb_for_my_drama_class/)  \\n\\\\#2: [[NSFW] \\\\[NSFW\\\\] Sasha leaked nudes!!!!!!!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/WpwS2me.png) | [2 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/SCJerk/comments/467pq7/nsfw_sasha_leaked_nudes/)  \\n\\\\#3: [&lt;--- If this post gets 200 upfuckromanreigns this subreddit will become NXT themed](https://np.reddit.com/r/SCJerk/comments/46z4db/if_this_post_gets_200_upfuckromanreigns_this/)\\n\\n----\\n^^I\\'m ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/6l7i0m/blacklist/) Miz is a heel, though. I feel like, rather than talking about fighting for respect, he should be talking about how fans only like him now that he\\'s famous, and how everyone else is too stupid or too jealous to appreciate his greatness, and how we can all kiss his ass. Did Reigns or Ambrose ever technically wrestle for NXT? Are sledgehammers allowed?  This one? https://youtu.be/MH1XM2FOXD4\\n\\nEDIT: Can\\'t format on mobile apparently  i can\\'t wait for Xapzod Fizzle-ZX39 to join Titus Brand Gotta love RuRu And this is how you go broke I\\'m not sure how you could have said they sucked if you never watched it? Your right. A guy who did full time training for the better part of 3 years, would get his ass handed to him by a guy who doesnt even know how to put on a worked kimura. V-trigger looks 1000 times better baited  Again? Wear and tear combined with him throwing his arms in the air. I have seen Kitamura around on facebook there is nothing about Social Media, since the likes of Henare have had social media for ages His debt collectors are pleased. You need a hobby. The referee with the untucked shirt deadass looks like Cory Graves  The ref with a fuckin V-Trigger!!! It is legit. Coincidences can happen too. If they were going to do that they could have just done what they did with Paige. Agreed. Yeah its fine to change your opinion of someone, nobody disputes that. Especially after something happens in the real world that totally ruins the character for people IE Enzo.  \\n\\n**But** and it\\'s a big but, the majority of people on here change their opinion of somebody literally based on nothing other than what the rest of the people on here think and that\\'s not really ok honestly. I\\'ve seen it happen countless times with guys like Ambrose and Rollins and Punk and even Nakamura, people shit on these guys for no reason other than the fact that everyone else does. \\n\\nI know someone will retort with \"Oh it\\'s almost as if there\\'s a hundred thousand people here and it\\'s almost as if all of them have differing opinions\" but that\\'s not a correct or fair argument. I\\'ve seen countless comments one month where people are using the most insane of hyperbole to describe how good a wrestler is, the next month everyone shits all over that wrestler and shits all over you if you\\'re  a fan of that wrestler. \\n\\nSee I have no problem if someone wants to follow the crowd and is weak minded enough to let other people choose their opinions for them, that isn\\'t what bothers me. It\\'s when the hive mind takes over and ruins all potential discussion about things that bothers me. Take Bayley for example, she\\'s an amazing worker. Incredibly over on NXT. My favourite women\\'s wrestler ever. I saw people get downvoted all because they said they\\'re still fans. That\\'s not cool and its rife in this place, happens every other month. \"Bitch I flex, Ric Flair\" Jesus fuck, was that wrestler or an episode of Jackass? Chyna seemed like she was trying to make inroads to repairing her life and reputation at the end, but then when WWE was basically like \"lolno\" things took a turn back for the worse. Found a Full Sail regular. Yes, but I don\\'t think it\\'s as much as what a GFW network would have. So we have to keep socmany active belts the they don\\'t even make the big shows? But you\\'re saying ECW wasn\\'t purely because it went out of business but WCW did too.. Better booking and better matches. Easily beats AE I though Nigel wasn\\'t signed because of his biceps injury and didn\\'t find about the Hep C until he went to TNA?  Good for you and thanks for telling us. Coal miners don\\'t get to set their own routine. BAH GAWD!\\n\\nFlair kicked out! Death cannot believe it! http://i.imgur.com/XMxR4GA.gif I won\\'t be alone! Fucking Rogan knows about the Shockmaster. Come on man. Problem with that is, Byron and Tom aren\\'t charismatic enough to carry the show, with just them.  This is right. Good God you\\'re a mark.   Really? That\\'s odd lol He\\'s seriously one of the greats of WWE right now and it sure as hell wouldn\\'t be the same without him.\\n\\nReally off topic... but I think if he was an attitude era wrestler, The Rock would call him... \"The Jizz\".  Government in Australia is slowly eroding Medicare here as well to push private health insurance more and more.\\n\\nThe rest of the world looks at the American system and shakes their head, but these wankers push to bring it in here anyway.  MY LOOOOORD! /u/ezzanine made a reply on /r/NJPW\\n\\n\"Wrestlers who don\\'t use their full names and only their last names are in caps\\n\\n-Seiya Sanada&gt;SANADA\\n\\n-Nobuo Yoshihashi&gt;YOSHI-HASHI\\n\\n-Yujiro Kushida&gt;KUSHIDA\\n\\n-Tetsuya Bushi&gt;BUSHI\" \\n\\nand i guess some people, like EVIL, use it as a stylistic thing Sasha sucks No no no no http://i.imgur.com/tuDvG6M.gif Was the first reply I saw, but I don\\'t have a twitter account, so maybe they order the replies/posts around a bit different for non-signed in users of the site. \\n\\nBut yeah! I caught it, too. I thought it was cool, eh?\\n\\nFor anyone wondering, Dale Jr just said \"Glad youre back, Legends never die\" or something to that effect. Then a random twitterer says \"Didn\\'t know ya liked wrestling, who are your faves?\"\\n\\nDale Jr. responded \"Dusty, Stone Cold, The Rock, Flair. I didn\\'t learn to appreciate til I was older, but he\\'s a rare talent\" (Talking about Flair). \\n\\nSo that\\'s what Dale Ernhart Jr. thinks about wrestling, I guess. \\nI don\\'t watch nascar shit, but I understand the idea. Cool to see cross sports love.  Is it possible to get that shirt online? I tried navigating the page but I had no luck finding it (also can\\'t read Japanese so that doesn\\'t help haha) Given her experience I thought she did a fantastic job. If you want to argue that there are plenty of very talented women out there who deserved a shot more than her that\\'s one thing, but if you just watch the match I think most people agree she was quite good.\\n\\nI also have a feeling that Khali may have his name on the school, but he\\'s not exactly doing a ton of hands on training. Final deletion is the only episode of the Pop TV era to pass 400,000 viewers. Apart from that episode, ratings have stayed in the consistent loop of 250-350K viewers with viewership trending down as they go deeper into taped shows and then spiking for live or near live. It depends on the locality. \\n\\nMine only charges for frivolous rides. \\n\\n\\nMost of the problem with ambulances are firefighters unions. With the improved fire standards, we don\\'t need as many, but firefighters fight to keep their jobs. So they go out on medical calls too (all fully suited up in case there\\'s a fire somewhere they need to go to during/after) so suddenly they have many many many times more calls than actual fire calls.\\n\\nThen the locality tries to spend their money on services, and the firefighters fight tooth and nail to keep their funding (using the above as justification) and there\\'s not that much to expand ambulance services. Ambulances get the short end of the stick cause they don\\'t have big unions.\\n It was a cash for gold scam what are you talking about haha I know a thing or two:\\n\\nJapanese basically has several different alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji (Chinese alphabets in Japanese context) and Romaji (Roman/English characters in Japanese context). Japanese schoolchildren are taught English as part of their normal high school curriculum, so everyone has some basic understanding of the alphabet. However, in romaji context they ONLY use the capital letters.\\n\\nSo wrestlers with all-caps names are just using the Romaji alphabet for their name, in the format they know. Their alphabet HAS no lower case Roman letters in it so Kenta (example) becomes KENTA by default.  http://i.imgur.com/tuDvG6M.gif If it costs any amount of money, I will not be subscribing.  Spotted the virgin &gt; Not everyone receives an hourly rate.\\n\\nNobody receives an \"hourly rate\" except for the day laborers who help set up/tear down.  People are paid a by-the-day rate based on many factors, based against their downsides.  Even HHH and Steph have downside guarantees (which they eclipse).\\n\\n&gt; Also, it\\'s fair to assume that he\\'s financially very comfortable\\n\\nThat\\'s not fair to assume at all.  He was an indy wrestler for years and then was a 30k/yr NXT wrestler for awhile.  He\\'s only been paid decent money for the last year.   I don\\'t want it to cover everything. \\n\\nI don\\'t want to pay hundreds a month for stuff I\\'m not at risk for.\\n\\nLet it truly be insurance not a healthcare funding plan. clearly photoshopped, why would they put Shawn\\'s face over stevie richards  Very Mysterious Ice Cream. So that\\'s why my laptop\\'s fan was working harder. And then there\\'s the [other](http://imgur.com/t2G720E.gifv) powerbomb BJ Whitmer gave to Jimmy Jacobs. HHH always exposing the business when he gets captured on house show footage. Whether it\\'s the curtain call, or clowning with Hebner, or here jumping up with furious offense while he should be laying and selling. It used to have shows like \"RV life\", \"Explore America\\'s oddest towns\" and other things. But the past year and a half, it started with day long marathons of \"A haunting\" and \"Ghost adventures\"... Now there are like 6 shows with ghost in it, there are also things about UFOs and other paranormal things on there. It was at the fan conclave at King of Trios. CCK were running a Fire Pro \\'booth\\' at it. Who the fuck said anything about being entitled to free or cheap medical care? Looking at your very short comment history, because you probably delete your idiotic comments after trying to stir shit up. You are an asshole. I really don\\'t feel like getting into this debate with you. So be well and go fuck yourself. Just wanted to say thanks for linking his shop page.\\n\\nGonna buy both shirts in support of Naitch pulling through. He\\'s said he won\\'t unless it\\'s with HHH and they get full creative control My idea would be that Rollins/Ambrose beat Sheamus and Cesaro in their rematch. Roman needs a 5th man, Cesaro and Sheamus offers their services to them IF they get another shot at the tag titles. They say they hate Cena and The Hardys a little bit more than they hate The Shield, so they are willing to put differences aside.\\n\\nThe Shield boys get Cesaro to be their partner as they trust him more than Sheamus (tying into Cesaro being the babyface at the beginning of the Sheamus/Cesaro partnership). Lol agreed I recognize your flair from somewhere. \\n\\nWonder where. Enjoy being a poverty striken little asshole who has to cry about being too poor to afford healthcare, hahaha enjoy suffering you lowlife. Do you not remember when Hogan went to TNA lmao? It was a train wreck from start to finish.  As long as you don\\'t push the stupid argument that the rock doesn\\'t count. Samoans are disproportionately involved in the wrestling business. If racism was the primary factor that wouldn\\'t be the case. If anything the opposite problem has often been the case where black wrestlers with potential get pushed too soon. I\\'ll subscribe for old Impact alone, but add in AAA and NOAH, and a good search function and I\\'d probably enjoy it more than WWE Network.  I do but then he was washed up already and we all saw what his power play was from miles away.  Eli Drake had this character down way before he got to Impact though.  The Shield. That\\'s in the games, I believe. Pretty sure it\\'s DDP\\'s default finish, or at least was in one of the recent games.  I see what you\\'re saying, but this mostly applies to specific communities within the IWC. I\\'m a member of another wrestling community that\\'s comprised of almost completely opposite opinions of those you\\'d see on r/SC. Okay, it\\'s been over a year so I should probably swallow my pride.\\n\\nIs that meant to be \\'AJ\\'? It just looks like \\'PI\\' to me.  That ref though. This deserves it\\'s own post. It\\'s sooo good But, to me, it made sense story-wise.  Punk was so fixated on Heyman that, when he had the upperhand, he pissed it away to get back at Heyman.  He\\'s like Willie E. Coyote - he redoubled his confidence once he lost his aim. To me, that\\'s the essence Punk\\'s character - monomaniacal \\n\\nPunk looked strong in it, and honestly was the last person until Goldberg who I could believe was able to beat Brock.  http://i.imgur.com/h4aK5in.jpg Damn  He can kiss any woman,  even that FAT one, and make her cry.\\n\\nYeah, you baby *hip thrust* barnett shouldnt see this Are you actually this stupid you don\\'t understand what a local affiliate is. \\n\\nDA is the biggest network roh has ever been on. Picked it. They\\'ve never been on a big national network just a slew of local affiliates and HDnet which was a tiny national network  [Wow...you really aren\\'t wrong.](https://youtu.be/DTjljdvCUUo) Funny that his cast mate that season was a Kevin Dunn Relegated to curtain jerking and a c-show is a backwards step for Aries and I commend him not allowing his value to be diminushed simply because \"wwe tho\" Everybody remembers Okadas dropkick. But which one? He did perfect one after 50 minutes with Omega.\\nWith all love and respect to AJ, butvhe didnt this Those are actually separated from each other. WGN is local to Chicago and WGN America is essentially a cable channel at this point. \\n\\nAnd yeah, just looked it up, RoH is only available in 1 of the top 20 markets in the US.  Seems like you can tell when they stopped caring about call ups(as far as having creative planned for them). Somewhere from Adam Rose to The Vaudevillains. Thank you.  I\\'m very glad they didn\\'t write off Maryse because she and Miz are gold but adding Bo and Curtis was a really great addition to Miz\\'s \"A-Lister\" run. Plus I\\'m just glad to see them on tv again! So we are officially in the \"Where\\'s Hangman\" Arc of BTE. Trainer? Keyword: Yet. Or steph.......... (   .   )(   .   ) Yeeea rather than giving the book to Shane and Daniel, hire proper bookers. I would also remove steph from creative as from what I heard she\\'s a bit of a bully or pushy with ideas and no one wants to tell her it\\'s stupid because they don\\'t want to get fired. \\n\\nAll your other ideas are great. Meltzer didn\\'t say that. It looks better. They did it at Takeover Brooklyn too. I think they do it at all the Takeovers. \\n\\nIt has nothing to do with T-shirts.  Every woman should ride Space Mountain at least once. Same from start to finish I was hyped.  Find one number on RoH, please. Back up that they are doing better than GFW. Cuz you haven\\'t brought any numbers to this, just \"they must do better than 300k\". Yeah, I hate that the WWE isolates the Cruiserweights from the rest of the roster. Ironically, it feels like Enzo is starting to bridge the gap. I have to say i have seen this quite often. Its popular here to jump on the bandwagons, but thats literally anywhere in society where theres a large group of ppl. Fear of not being accepted causes this. When i first joined reddit i was under the impression downvotes where to limit and remove trolls and inappropriate comments, not to shit on someone who is posting a legitimate OPINION to a FORUM...ya know, like its for...\\n\\nI was a complete WWE only mark when i joined. Now im almost physically repulsed by the promotion and wreddit is partly to blame but in a good way. It introduced NJPW and PWG into my life. Of course i have my own personal favorites from hours and hours of watching backlogged events and taking suggestions, but I\\'ve learned opinions like \"shabata v okada\" was better imo that \"omega v okada\" will get you destroyed if you care for karma Syfy is mostly old movies that well the old SciFi version of the channel would never play as they aren\\'t SciFi.... and stupid shark movies that have reached a point it\\'s clear they no longer care about quality.\\n\\nHistory Channel at least has History on it sometimes. So you\\'re saying the budget came up a little short in that regard? Let the story play out They did the same thing at (at least) the last 2 Takeovers, as well, and nobody noticed or complained.  Holy shit, you actually think roh is on cw nationally not just your local affiliate which happens to be a cw channel \\n\\nhttp://www.rohwrestling.com/tv/listings\\n\\nHere you go buddy. There\\'s all the channels roh is on. Notice how it\\'s not cw in every city. That\\'s called a local affiliate  Poor Viktor Kenny King ain\\'t shit.  I just saw the video on the front page and remembered that I had herd that promo before, here\\'s the IMPACT video for comparison: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckR5H3mcg2A Reigns yes, but barely\\n\\nAmbrose, no Nobody. There is nothing that resonates in GFW. Less than 300,000 viewers is less than Pop gets for their soap opera reruns. Lol dude you\\'re the biggest child I\\'ve ever seen. I\\'m providing you the proof, me in fucking attendance. If that doesn\\'t count for you then oh well.  Especially Hardy Boyz fans who are unaware of the legal kerfluffels right now. They\\'ve got access to both of their singles and tag team runs, and may very well introduce newer fans to the Broken universe. Rush is an honorary member of LIJ since he was with them for Tag League.  Krispin Wah! yeah i thought i was missing something, but nothing is spelled wrong or anything, i think op is trolling us Lol oh my god. Did your shitty gameplay get flagged or something. If it was highly illegal they wouldn\\'t be able to do it bud  Yeah I think both those guys.  Keep Sting as a special appearance. Heart break, kid... I thought Austin was gonna stun him at the end  Nah I think public opinion has come around on this issue.  Do people still want to be entertained tho?  Sure. Ambrose and Rollins are this eras Rock and Austin in terms of rivalry  There\\'s a post about this every week. Pretty sure whatever trademark issues there were cleared up.\\n\\nBut it\\'s gonna be tough getting a TV deal, he couldn\\'t land one for RPW and the main reason he wanted to buy TNA was because of the infrastructure and TV deals already in place. So, it\\'ll probably be a while before we hear anything significant about it. Bryan was taken out to protect Roman\\'s push.  tinfoil hat?  sure, but the more that comes out the more it makes sense. lol you want me to link me standing in the crowd? lol also what is this autistic tactic of \"get out\" are you incapable of arguing.\\n\\nI\\'m literally arguing with you, someone who doesn\\'t know what a local affiliate channel is, and you don\\'t see me telling you to leave.  I\\'ll be interested when he buys the nWo. Which one? He was hospitalized for a number of days, but for what, I don\\'t think anyone knows. There were all kinds of rumors flying around as to what his ailment was, but I don\\'t think anyone but his family actually knows. JIMMY! I\\'ve always been a massive fan of Bray Wyatt. The ring gear, the entrance, the promos, I love all of it. It\\'s such a shame how he and the Family have been booked. Every other match on the card save for Dijak/Lee is more exciting to me.  \\n\\nThis is a deep card.  The only thing I\\'m a fanboy of is good wrestling Felt a bit like a cleaner Joel Gertner promo too For real, we get some bs news about a wrestlers new shoes or something, but info shed on this. Yeah. That autism is hittin hard  Could be like FloSlam &amp; charge like $30 lol Ah! That makes sense.\\n\\nThis whole time I just assumed it was A and J laid on top of each other. Having enough lights to cover the ringside area is the point.  When being thrown out the ring is like going into a black hole, that\\'s dumb. What\\'s the title of the video? *Wrestling fans in general If you\\'re looking for shock value Brock Lesnar, Cena or Roman Reigns would be the top three for me. Better start practicing your \"oh my\\'\" line, Michael  There was another version that was better Because it wasn\\'t that bad.  You could see people when they left the ring.  This was far worse. Oh, the vocals on this would be fun... Yeah but this isn\\'t. He had a tryout, but I don\\'t think he got an offer. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO You mean *Fight* Network? I thought Fite was an online PPV service? In your opinion. CM Punk.\\n\\nUnless sticking strictly to CURRENT stars?\\n\\nJohn Cena. My mother was always young for her age till she had a bit of a close call and spent a few days in the hospital, she came back and suddenly she was the old woman she\\'d outpaced for years. I didn\\'t like it. Get an education  He\\'s beyond living legend; he\\'s Ace He\\'s a crazy motherfucker named Angst Cube. There seemed to be miscommunication in the reporting. Apparently, Steve got word that WWE had an interest in him and wanted to see him at their tryouts. Steve\\'s contract was up and he opted to take a shot and tryout.\\n\\nRumor was WWE passed on him, with some saying because he is legally blind. But it\\'s all really conjecture at this point, unless Steve decides to talk about it. He\\'s off working the indy circuit for the time being. But not mine so oh well. Could we use Tamina instead of Nia tho? Nia looks like someone crammed 15 pounds of crap into a five pound sack and is way to weak to use her size threateningly\\n\\nLike if you poorly described Awesome Kong to someone who never saw wrestling Nia Jax is what they would come up with. They do have a great story, which is why it\\'s sad that the WWE really didn\\'t have plans for them after reuniting them, and having them win the tag titles. It makes no sense that their heat is being wasted by just having them face Cesaro and Sheamus in different combinations. a system that one party of government is actively trying to eliminate.  Reassuring to the rest of us that have 30+ years before we hit 65.  Oh ok. Thought for sure they\\'d have it in NY/LA/etc Oh that\\'s my favorite response. FYI I\\'ve been here longer then he has and when you\\'re argument turns into \"you\\'re a shill\" you lost Wasn\\'t he known for not catching people when they dove on him? I liked it, have the spotlight on the wrestlers, makes it feel important  What about Cena? Blake and Murphy are so underutilised. Too bad he can\\'t catch. You keep replying  I\\'ll give you upvotes for taking the failure like a champ, instead of whining and arguing that I don\\'t know funny. You\\'re right Yeah, the concept is cool but they went too dark, that\\'s my point.\\n\\nThe outside part of the ring where they brawl shouldn\\'t resemble 3.30am. HBK looks great for his age, and I don\\'t know how. Yeah mine was $80. I think they pretty much have to to keep people from abusing it. I miss Book Marks. I read a lot of good books I otherwise wouldn\\'t have known about if it wasn\\'t for Lance.  Kota Ibushi Yes and takes the focus off what is going on in the crowd. Just like when they started not showing live feed on the titantrons.  Not him. Just both of us agree that you\\'re an idiot.\\n\\nhttp://www.voicesofwrestling.com/2016/01/13/2015-year-end-stats-star-ratings-tv-attendance-wwe-njpw-nxt-roh/\\n\\nThat has the ratings for when RoH was on a national channel. It never beat TNA.  Batista was 1 until he was getting wayyyy as WHC on SD! over the RAW WWE champ, John Cena, so they turned him heel while he was white hot.\\n\\nAfter that they got the horrorshow started that was LOLCENAWINS FUCK THIS IIRC this was in the feud between Bobby Lashley and Simon Dean, then during his workout guru Simon System gimmick. The stipulation of the match was if Simon lost, he would eat 20 hamburgers. In terms of a performer that puts over the belt as consistently at possible, I would be inclined to agree. Rock, Austin, Bret and Y2J are certainly in the mix too Holy shit, I remember watching this live on Superstars back in the day.  Alexa. She\\'s been a face for a while (not really but fuck it, I\\'ve been cheering her for years, she\\'s great). Oh am I? Lol this is sad  Does that count as DQ by using a foreign object? Anyone legit worried, is slow in the brain................. So much wrestling, so little time. I wish I had 24 hours just for it Is Juice\\'s character based partially on him being very promiscuous? I only know of him from the G1 stuff. *Medicare. Not medicaid. No way Ric qualifies for, medicaid. Sinclair makes their money in the secondary markets. They don\\'t compete with the big boys and have shit production values on their news broadcasts. They are in for a rude awakening in Chicago if they think it will hack it with a second rate broadcast. They already lost their top anchor.  Did you actually watched the match? It was no dq and it played immensely into Punk\\'s favor. He never out grappled or out powered Lesnar, he outsmarted him. It was booked perfectly and it would\\'ve made sense for Punk to go over, in fact, Lesnar had to cheat to win. Yes I agree, it starts off the same, but higher tempo.  Love Eli Drake, was a fan of that promo with the GFW title... but the fact that he ripped the promo word for word off an earlier one he\\'s probably been doing for years in front of a mirror makes it feel less impressive. Still a good promo guy, I just don\\'t know why he couldn\\'t tell a different anecdote? Sure buddy, just keep downvoting everyone who disagrees with you and be positive that you\\'re correct... Moron.  In MYC/NXT\\'s defense, the women rarely have spots that go outside the ring, so it\\'s not like it\\'s a huge priority. Seth\\'s knee just doesn\\'t feel like a finish for me. It looks so transitional and its not as impactful as it should be. Every time he hits the move it takes me a few seconds to think \"oh shit that was his finisher. I totally forget that\\'s his finisher\".  Not just WWE but he\\'s set with MTV as well, since he\\'s a real world alumni   Ive seen many of these being sold at the markets in Hong Kong! The quality is terrible and some of them are hilarious!  I\\'m a dietitian in a hospital and the first thing I said to my husband was \"they didn\\'t implement nutrition in a timely manner.\" I would wear that to every fucking wrestling show I went to for the rest of my life. Yeah I was flicking through local channels &amp; the difference between them &amp; the other production wise is bad lol The worst part is, the all red everything bits where she wouldn\\'t wrestle were actually funny. It\\'s a shame they could never build on it They did 650 and 330 for Staten Island and St. James respectively. They also had to cancel a show because they couldn\\'t sell enough tickets.\\n\\n Is it \"yes\"? The Bermuda Triangle is a thing bruh....or did I get way too high again? I hate myself for making this comment but I\\'m gonna leave it up out of shame.  I literally linked the exact video OP was looking for...  I think I\\'m deaf as a post I love you too, random citizen. I always hated Edge\\'s spear. Also, The way he hit the move was dangerous to himself. He hurt his neck a few times doing it. It was the finishing blow for his career too when he hurt himself doing it to Brodus Clay.  They did it for Kairi in the MYC. Oh, it\\'s unavailable through the link.... Go to YT and type either \"Monday night wars on 4 minutes\" or Dixie Carter yells at TNA superstars  Please tell me there was some sort of thick padding down there. Because how he\\'s not dead from otherwise is amazing. It\\'s also shit like this that kills people. It\\'s mad that Vince\\'s loan has more comments than the (various) domestic abuse allegations in this article.  I want WWE to edit the entire match like this. What if all of the stories about drug use and abuse were just kayfabe and Ric was just a super health nut the whole time?  And to be honest EC3 only did maybe half of the work. Ever since he went to TNA he\\'s been treated as the company\\'s ace: whenever there was going to be a big name being brought in he was the one they had them feud with, and wrestling-wise he developed so much from that. His matches went from old DSW/FCW developmental guy to actually watchable. They\\'re never going to have Neville leave, because he\\'s the anchor. They could have easily replaced him with Aries, but they didn\\'t, and they don\\'t have a replacement, now.\\n\\nAnd that sucks because Neville is worth more than that. Since he\\'s on Raw, he\\'d be perfect for the Intercontinental Championship. Wear it front row at a WWE PPV and you\\'d get your own sidebar image here at SC. Not gonna lie (Im Cenas Number 1 Fan Btw) but thats exactly what happened, Vince saw he was getting as hot as his guy so he had to beat him. In what was a series of Cena wins. At least the feud should\\'ve been close and down to the wire like Batista-Taker... they were the undisputed top guys after all... What\\'s my fair share? The shirt is fucking terrible and doesn\\'t match at all, that\\'s way worse than the miscut suit. I need someone to explain this whole \"blind\" thing, ASAP. So you\\'re saying he\\'s Ray Charles-level blind? Or he just has pretty bad eye sight? Dr. Wagner Jr. is a legend Now that\\'s what I call, a sticky situation. I dig it, sucka  Took the words right out of my mouth. Amazing match and one of my favourites  of all time too. I didn\\'t know many people loved this match the way I did. Surprised to see so much love being shown to it in this thread! Dude has two PICC lines in his left (on our right) arm, still schilling his (awesome) gear.\\n\\nHe just doesn\\'t know what it is to stop. When he dies, his body won\\'t know it. Are we all forgetting how awesome Survivor Series 2016 was? Is there a gif of when aj lee, i think threw her out of the ring, she sold it for a minute then posed and remembered that she was suppose to be selling The delivery got better too. You can tell confidence is the main thing the guy worked his ass off building. At the moment Billy Corgan is focusing his efforts on planning. The man is looking at the current situation and working with a number of people to find the best course of action. While we know little of any actual plans we do have a idea that the NWA will be looking to become a single company and ditch the membership program it has had for sixty years as evidence by NWA Smokey Mounatin (The largest NWA territory) recently deciding to leave the NWA and become INTEGRITY Pro.\\n\\nThe NWA is still running events as normal but the man just purchased that organization a few months ago and is taking his time in making a game plan. Could you kindly leave that 9gag shit over at 9gag, ok? Bye bye  http://www.allaboutvision.com/lowvision/legally-blind.htm\\n\\nIf you scroll down, there\\'s a slider that gives you an impression. He was also established in the business with the horsemen long before Nash, which combined with his premature hair loss did it. \\n\\nHall had been around forever too but a lot of people don\\'t recall pre-Diamond Studd when he was a redneck cowboy. War Machine are apparently free agents, they are probably up there.  Ahh yes, surely if he gets his ass kicked by Big Cass then Braun Strowman should be no problem for him.  i mean that dude is the most un-controversial cookie cutter smark in the fucking world. he pretends to have like the most unique opinions and he\\'s never said anything i haven\\'t heard a million times on this sub, i could imagine him going with the flow as far as his opinions go. people love broken matt so it\\'s not far fetched to think that\\'s why he does too. He is past his prime, Injured to near death and definetly not in the best shape. I would love to see him wrestle again but it ain\\'t looking likely. Where is Will Ospreay signed? Brooklyn I, Dallas, Chicago, Toronto, San Antonio, Brooklyn III, R-Evolution, Orlando That man is 20 years older than me and I know that no matter what I do in the next 20 years, there\\'s no way I\\'ll be as cool as that at his age. Damnit.  Ooooh. Miz/Hardy sounds like a PPV match. I\\'m actually hoping that Jeff as a singles competitor finally starts a Broken/Woken Matt path.  Woo tangy! I love how literal the lyrics on this entire album were.\\n\\n\"Here comes Johnny B. Badd... you don\\'t want to make him mad... he\\'s as pretty as a picture... he looks just like Little Richard\".\\n\\nAnd the biographical steiners theme where the lyrics were like \"they started out with high school... and then they went to michigan... and became all americans.. and then did it a second time too!\".\\n\\nI think there was a \"his name is cactus jack and he dont even have a family!\" chorus too.\\n\\nRude and Stings themes were definitely the best. All that and he deletes his account...  thats hayuntingly accurate. The only other decoration i hve is from another guest from China who gave me a nice framed symbol that I honestly have no idea what it means but it too was a gift. So you walk into my living room and boom theres a picture of the boogey man and a chinese symbol.  Doesn\\'t matter, sooner or later the Anoa\\'i family will adopt her like they adopted Joe. \\n\\nSource: Samoa Joe on Talk Is Jericho\\n\\n The Rock\\n\\nCM Punk &gt; And that sucks because Neville is worth more than that. Since he\\'s on Raw, he\\'d be perfect for the Intercontinental Championship.\\n\\nWhich is apparently why aries left, he didn\\'t wanna be stuck in the C division. Can\\'t have a FREE trip to the front of the line  I agree.  He is a little rocky now, compared to to win Dusty was still around and they were battling the shield, but he, if anyone could maybe get the people on his side for a true, maybe one of the last pure babyface runs This is why i hate youtube \"I don\\'t like these indie scrubs, give me unknown, nobody scrubs!\" - Ultimate wrestling hipster One of the most underrated matches of the last decade.  I think he was using an alt and double posting so he might\\'ve gotten banned They need to just scrap the purple show and have the cruiserweights actually be a part of raw like people wanted in the first place. Yea hopefully that area gets a good show at some point I\\'m just thinking 2 months might be to soon to try and sell tickets and put the event there. If you\\'re in the Houston area glad you\\'re alright I was all over texas as a kid I liked it down there The legendary guitarist, Z Pak Wylde. I would not watch it even if they paid me. He\\'s 5\\'8 with boots on. No the axe is actually the Black Rangers weapon of choice that\\'s cool and all but wtf am I supposed to do with the 3TB worth of gifs I made to post and collect karma in case Ric didn\\'t *kick out at 2* ?? ?? ?? [Hmmmm](http://i.imgur.com/dCuLBaR.gifv) I picked up Bischoff\\'s book brand new, paperback edition, for about £8 at the time (same price I paid for The Rock\\'s and Brock Lesnar\\'s, HBK\\'s was £10, Bret Hart\\'s was £40). That plus a different account backing him got deleted as well. Idk. People got too much time. I\\'ll argue for days but the effort to make alts and manipulate votes is too much lol  Should have calling it Owlvision.  Anyone else think that this whole thing about her starting the women\\'s revolution is gonna lead to a Paige or Summer Rae return? An artist was drawing my brothers car, and I helped with the wheels. I imagine being stuck there doing nothing would be somewhat different than being champion and waiting for someone else (maybe Cedric) so he could then also move up. At the end, did Tenay say \"Did you see that fuck face\"? Probably for long term antibiotics.  Mr Nowinski, Mr. Lawler, and Kevin Owens are on the guest list. What\\'s it look like?

Naw\\nGeneric random underdog the IWC falls in love with.\\n\\nSee Christian, Lance Storm Cody Rhodes pre indie stuff. The mark is the one who thinks the guy trained for only professional wrestling would beat the guy who trained for both professional wrestling and MMA sad Nation of Domination theme NAITCH!!! No, it was and is very split. You either loved it and thought wow, this is wrestling, or you hated it and thought wow, this isn\\'t wrestling. I noticed it seemed more HD than last week  Are those New Loves Enzo\\'s wearing? Yep. Rude Awakening over a chair during the on the fly wrap job. Me and my friend used to lose it every time, back in the day. I wonder how guys at WWE feel about how well Juice has done since he left. Guys meaning officials and Triple H and whoever. Like, I wonder if they think \"ffs we dropped the ball with this kid\" or are they like proud of him for going out and taking a risk and doing so well.  So would they get DQd if they tossed Natalya? She\\'s from Canada  I guess learning to speak Mandarin was all for nothing.  Would they run out of space on the on-screen name plate with all those Us? In terms of the right combination of star power and bridges burned with TNA? AJ Styles or the Hardy Boyz. based...\\n yeah she didn\\'t do anything wrong- she\\'s strong enough to do everything she did safely. the fluidity and stuff takes some time Chris, Jerry, KO. Well done Yes just keep using that stuff from 20-30 years ago as a crutch.  It totally that he isn\\'t making mistakes now, or that he can never be criticized for his decisions, which have cost WWE popularity in recent years.\\n\\nOh wait no, it means neither of those things.  If all you\\'ve got to defend him now is stuff that happened DECADES ago, then your argument is shaky to say the least. Well done, mate If we\\'re talking about the greatest ppv in the last 10 years I really don\\'t think so. But that ppv was definitely better than it had any right to be. Dick Murder\\n\\nDick Murdoch He was Roman in NXT.  You would\\'ve thought that Alexa would basically be the face of the woman\\'s division. tell me that you bought that t shirt. I dunno if irl I would take haich\\'s tie and flick him in the face with it That\\'s good, but that\\'s incorrect. But you don\\'t have much time left Ric! It\\'s a funny promo, and there\\'s a difference between doing a rough version of it in front of 50 people at an indy show and national TV. What a billy. For a while yeah, but then around 2008-2009 he was often in the background (both on RAW and SD) and kind of directionless. Meanwhile, Cena, HHH, Orton, \\'Taker, Edge, and at times others like Jeff Hardy, Y2J, HBK and CM Punk, all seemed to be more important to the big stories going on in the company. Wait, so the doctor who has forced Daniel Bryan into retirement over CTE is now dismissing it and Corbin is the only one speaking out?\\n\\nSo what is the deal?  If WWE are letting their doctor be so dismissive, do they think Bryan is gonna drop dead any day now while every other doctor he has seen says he has the brain function of a normal, average human being (as taken from the Edge and Christian podcast).\\n\\nWhat a mess this concussion stuff really is. Corey and Byron are gold together People werent watching impact week to week to tune into the Hardys they watched youtube  The Bermuda triangle is an area near Bermuda. Bermuda itself is not a triangle. You got World? I made a post about his run two months ago, with links to matches on World, with some explanations and context.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6ky86d/hirai_kawato_an_undercard_storyline_in_njpw_worth/ Harry \\'Beaver\\' Cleavage - AKA Headbanger Mosh Yes, there\\'s a post on the front page talking about why he did it.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6xjrwx/kevin_owens_on_why_he_dropped_the_face_of_america/ Uh, yes he did. For sure, keeping up with NOAH is so hard for someone without Samurai TV. If they post big shows and stuff i\\'d be willing to pay a premium &gt; Considering those two are like best friends in real life\\n\\nAre they? I\\'ll always believe that was intentional. Like, the plan always being these weird vignettes for a super mysterious and creepy gimmick and then the guy playing it shits on it as an example of a worked shoot about the gimmicks there were at the time in pro wrestling.\\n\\nRemember, at the time, the FCC were on WCW about the Nitro Girls and the violence in the hardcore division, so Russo repackaged Lodi and Lenny Lane as the tag team Standards &amp; Practices, along with renaming one of the Nitro Girls as their assistant, Ms. Hancock (who\\'d do sexy dances in mini skirts anyway).\\n\\nPlus, Jarrett called his finish The Stroke and talked about how much stroke he had backstage (mocking some of WWF\\'s top stars), while the Harris twins came in wearing suits as the tag team Creative Control.\\n\\nThe whole time was 4th wall breaking, and while some seemed to have hated it (which I never knew until 2004), I enjoyed it. He got his ass kicked by teddy hart.  Stop.   Punk is q great wrestling personality.   He\\'s tough as a piece of sugar glass. It\\'s so fucking annoying with things like the enzo situation because it\\'s like\\n\\n&gt;person is generally well liked\\n\\n&gt;comes out that the person is a dick who does bad things\\n\\n&gt;people start to hate the person\\n\\n&gt;_\"WTF Why does everyone hate Enzo now y\\'all loved him yesterday!?!?\"_ How do you feel now that Ric Flair didn\\'t die?  I\\'m so glad HHH lost that triple threat match against Shawn Michaels I always wished there could\\'ve been a promotion just for guys like Blackman. WWF at that same time had access to Steve Williams, Ken Shamrock, and Dan Severn also. Those guys should\\'ve been killing it but got used so poorly instead. It\\'s too bad.  Hey man as a Booker The answer to all of your questions is a resounding \"Yes\".\\n\\nIt\\'s only internet marks like those on this sub who hate her, for some weird reason. She\\'s talented as hell but I assume she\\'s way out of these kids\\' leagues, so they hate her for weird reasons. Yes, and he\\'s not that horrible, you get used to the Bros and brothers.  And then there\\'s Miz who doesn\\'t give a fuck and will never turn down a request from fans.   In the RR 2005 Puder got chopped to shit by Eddy Guerrero, Chris Benoit and Hardcore Holly, I\\'m guessing that\\'s the hazing. At least we got the Curb Stomp to RKO spot. Also, props to Cesaro for the assistance. Based on what they put out there, it certainly seems so How about DB on commentary? He was great on the CWC and you can do a story that he is just filling in until he can find a new commentator. Only issue is that I\\'m not sure he is on a full time schedule yet after Birdie\\'s arrival  You should just paste all of that here to make it easier to click on links. Jerry\\'s kid.  Youre being rediculous clearly this was my opinion.   \"Source\".  Wtf lol And thank you for the compliments! That\\'s Panther Girl. It\\'s fans like these which give people the impression that they\\'re entitled brats,she\\'s honestly ok at meet and greets like anyone else but if you cross the privacy cum personal space line it\\'s not okay and really irritating,and that applies to all of us,not just wrestlers Rick Steiner has let himself go! Why would you think that? He had that reputation when he was working on the indies.  bad bot\\n bald jokes incoming Literally seconds from the playoffs and he blows it.  You know who else beat the odds to reach his dreams, that\\'s right, mah boi Ryder. He is the personification of the many kids who were during the golden age of Wrestling. He got cancer, he beat it. He could not get screentime, he made it. He got buried hard, he got up and tried again. And he is now one step further from a grand slam(if jinder and bray can, so can Zack) He is one of the best Midcarders of WWE . \\n\\nAnd not to mention, he\\'s dated the 2 hottest chicks to ever graduate from Lance storm\\'s storm Wrestling academy (Chelsea and Emma)(Taya is still with Johnny).\\n\\nAnd even if he does not have screentime, he is the official toy reviewer of WWE. \\n\\nAnd he is also good in the locker room. Noone speaks ill of him in shoot interviews, not even Ryback or Cody (idk about gotch)\\n\\nSorry for the long post.  I would absolutely love Big Show on a permanent or semi-regular role in a commentary team. As a long time wrestler he has the veteran ring knowledge that can add so much to a match and has a unique knack for putting everyone and everything happening totally over. The was a match a few years back when he was acting as an Authority enforcer that they randomly plopped him down with JBL, Cole, and Lawler and he absolutely killed it. Sold me on his commentary ever since. That step-up dropkick on the apron being his first offensive move was perfect too I think this was an interpromotional match, Tenzan was in that tag match. Okada was a young lion and taking the pin It\\'s true, I got my bachelors in wrestling and I work for minimum wage. I should really get my doctorate  Well Toyota center and most of downtown was unaffected  Preshow, maybe? That\\'s not Dr Wagner, that\\'s gianluca vacchi. He\\'s Italian.  Yeah I really hate when people think there is a hivemind and not just there being a reason that many people change their mind at once. I remember like a year or two ago Ziggler got really stale and I got bored of him, So did plenty of people but expressing this had so many people trying to call you out for it. Like wrestling is about personalities so it is pretty easy to flip and flop on certain people. Even worked a couple of dark matches this past month. he could be a ref since he\\'s legally blind Should have a real good chance of keeping it then:) Holy shit. Yeah, if Enzo was pushed into ANY championship reign while promoting branded beach balls and being managed by Sexy Star, who interfered in matches and was responsible for both real and storyline injuries. They\\'d have to leave the building in armored cars with police escorts.  It\\'s ok, Seth avenged him by taking out Sting Kurt angle is a wrestling machine that runs on painkillers Is that a Stone Cold Steve Austin skull behind Cena?  I like how he\\'s just covering up some generic wrestling logo with an upside down wrestler on it. Sounds like a good way to get an RKO outta nowhere from John \"The Viper\" Cena. Exactly. Like anyone else she\\'s completely fine at meet and greets or even running into fans in public like she said. She just values her privacy and personal space and people stalking airports and hotels for her to sign stuff is just completely ignoring her privacy and is super creepy. It\\'s really weird to me that so many people call Sasha a bitch for valuing her privacy and calling out stalking. Cass took the same bump. Somber Bailey entrance. Really upbeat Finn Balor entrance theme.  Yeah I know. Marks gotta mark. How many Raw matches has Otunga commentated since the shakeup? Whoa. Hold the fucking phone. Who was goldust\\'s new protege from like three weeks ago? Please do we need the ratings to rise and hopefully to get out of the theme park.  5 STARS\\n\\n0 NECK Edge and Christian have the right of it. Absolutely no room for that kind of shit in the business and i hope she doesn\\'t get bookings anywhere decent. They pretty clearly are inspired by how the U.S. healthcare system works. Theresa May at the very least wants our system to be like theirs. Being in the UK, I grew up watching WCW Worldwide on ITV on Saturday afternoons, then through Nitro and Thunder on TNT on Fridays on cable and Worldwide on Channel 5 in the late 90s/early 00s.\\n\\nOh, and they toured the UK several times. I went to a WCW house show in March 2000 and another in November 2000. A Scott Hall meet and greet in 1999 was a big deal, promoted by Radio 1, and they did some tapings for international broadcasters in big arenas in all the major cities, too.\\n\\nWhen did you grow up? The 00s? No wonder you missed WCW being on British TV. im not spoonfeeding you everything The hearts over the tights is such a great touch This type of reaction is ok imo. But when you turn on wrestlers for the way they’re booked then it’s a problem examples being Bayley, Bray, and Sasha So every tag to Abyss was technically a blind tag? Yes this is correct Get rid of writers and hire a booker.\\n\\nNo more scripted promos\\n\\nMore clean finishes/less hokey stories. SIKE! \\n\\n Yup. And i still posted it.  I agree.  I prefer physical.  Same with music and video games.\\n\\nEveryone wants to go digital but what if I buy all my PS4 games on PSN then they remove it (like the PT demo) or it shuts, all my money gone and no product.  At least the disc would still work.\\n\\nNot a big fan of the digital revolution (although its ease of access to global content is great). You\\'re* sorry its a pet peeve of mine and its something that completely changes the context of a sentence.  And as long as Jerry Lawler is alive, Memphis will always be a stop. Why did Maroon mention Corbin by name to begin with? That\\'s pretty much asking for it right there. It\\'s amazing they\\'ve gone as long as they have without just one wrestler nutting up to sue them for their blatantly illegal independent contractor deals.\\n\\nThe NLRB, DOL, and maybe even the IRS would have a field day with WWE if any of the talent had enough brains and backbone to do something about it. You obviously know zero about toughness Yes.  \\n\\nHow does it feel being the only JBL fan? That\\'ll put some dollars in the checking account... Orton, Styles and Nakamura have tried and failed. I think the tag match where he teamed with Shawn Michaels against McMahon was [his only appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMGWWpyFGFU). Possibly hbk vs Austin at mania 14?\\n\\nAnd regardless of what people say I loved Wyatt ca taker at WM31 I don\\'t know Heyman weeks before Nitro debuted said this would end Eric Bischoff. That he couldn\\'t compete with Vince on Monday nights and he would be beaten and humiliated and then released. Now sure eventually that rang true a half decade after Paul said it. \\n\\nI\\'d say that Nitro is going to go down on the thing the most insiders got wrong. Vince laughed it off, Dave mentioned he thought it would fail, Paul thought it would fail, nobody saw what was coming and even before the nWo they were winning more than they were losing.  &gt;The idea of a \"Japanese Network\" is a total pipe dream for me \\n\\nWell, FightingTv(SamuraiTv) exists but can\\'t legally watch it outside of Japan. It\\'s basically a 24 hour wrestling channel with pretty much all the big name promotions in Japan, both male and female with some Kickboxing/MMA thrown in there for some variety. \\n\\nYou can get this with an IPTV, but it wouldn\\'t be legal and you are looking at anywhere from $20-30/month. Even Styles failed to do that... yeah that guy would be in contention too Lonely By all accounts he seems like a major asshole but I did enjoy him on commentary Not to mention, it adds an atmosphere that WWE and NJPW haven\\'t even tried to build with the chat.  The events I\\'ve watched live on Twitch have been a blast. That two grand is quite a bit when there was no reason for them to get that.  I think Wrestlemania 30 deserves to be on the list too. [So lonely](https://youtu.be/UEaKX9YYHiQ) Well it is /r/squaredcircle. Overdramatic hyperbole is more or less the subs gimmick. I want one so bad now. Nope. JBL is great. Jinder? His run has been all time awful. Not one good match and he cuts the same promo every week. Orton (09), Lesnar (17), Jericho (08), Undertaker (08 and 09/10), Edge (07/08, 10/11 and 11), Owens (16/17) and Cena (08/09 and 10) were all better than Jinder and Miz\\'s runs. They\\'ll rush him onto the roster soon enough  Honestly? His entire feud with Jimmy Jacobs. One of the most heated, intense blood feuds I\\'ve ever seen. Start to finish, these two massacred each other in the ring and told one of the best stories in the history of ROH. The final match between them at Supercard of Honor II is a 5 star classic in my book but I don\\'t know if would resonate quite as much without having visited their backstory.\\n\\nIf you want a quick one off, his match with Steve Corino at Best in the World 2016, vs. Charlie Haas at the anniversary show, or vs. Go Shiozaki.\\n\\nHim and Dan Maff had a great street fight with Punk &amp; Steel at Death Before Dishonor II.\\n\\nWhitmer is more of a hardcore guy than a technical guy. Just know what you\\'re getting yourself into. It wasn\\'t a bad match. A bit awkward at some points but not bad. Kavita Devi is green but not very. She showcased some good sequences with Dakota Kai as a powerhouse and Dakota made it look great. Miz is a consummate professional. Like a legitimate [\"A-Lister\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg0B0sHJL2w), he takes these autograph hounds in his stride.\\n &gt;talks about when he was a wrestler\\n&gt;I was talking about his commentary Now I want to see a new BAMF! Blake. Asuka. Murphy. Factor. Somewhere in Hawaii, Tuli\\'s jaw started hurting a little bit, and he has no idea why. It\\'s definitely a bubble that\\'s going to pop, but some will sort themselves out. Probably WWE, NJPW, and some service like fightnetwork will be left standing, with smaller promotions joining them. Who is this motherfucker? I liked JBL as a wrestler, and he was very entertaining as a commentators. 30 bucks... A Month ?? heh Tony is big on good talkers.  Initially came up with Ultimo Dragon in his Toryumon School I believe before moving to New Japan as a young lion. Ultimo Dragon and Nagata are attributed as his two main trainers As a singles competitor, you\\'re probably right. Good bot Not in it\\'s current form What was that promo that involved Miz telling AJ he was in Japan growing his hair out for America\\'s Next Top Soccermom? I never liked him as a singles I liked his run in the APA tho I didn\\'t mind him as a commentator they\\'ve had worse. I don\\'t really take the bully stuff into consideration simply because there\\'s so much we don\\'t know. I don\\'t doubt the stories he\\'s a dick but if you look hard enough you can find dirt on everyone so I don\\'t let that stuff influence me But it did effect other people\\'s commentary work...Mauro??? *Hyped It\\'s [this](http://i.imgur.com/NpxcJ3g.png), without the text/bottom stars. &gt;almost At least that gets them main show tv time and might actually put em in matches people care about, unlike the shitty piss break \"just throw em all in a tag match\" matches they get now. like the great matches gable was in. Or they could be tag teams, imagine maybe a lince dorado and kalisto tag team.\\n A vignette: a brief evocative description, account, or episode.\\n\\nBrock and Undertaker\\'s backstage brawling edited down to just \"I\\'m going to kill you\" \"YOU\\'RE GOING TO HAVE TO!\" was a pre-match vignette, it condensed their feud down to a few seconds and a soundbyte. \\n\\nThe montage of CM Punk\\'s ass kicking in still photos on RAW was a vignette. \\n\\nThis was an edited promo package to promote the fight. Is this real? That sounds farfetched... I think it is just the nature of Reddit. Whatever is the common sentiment will get the most upvoted and be more visible. There always is different opinions and the most popular one can shift quite easily.  I only talked about his commentary in the OP. And refer to my response to /u/kobe_the_jobber for that point. suprisingly, roman. Miz really seems like someone who would have been crazy over in WCW. Why is this in quotes? Did someone else say it? If so, maybe add an attribution at the end. \\n\\nAlso, this \"quote\" is laughably wrong. I often disagree with Meltzer, but he is an excellent journalist. His coverage of the steroid trial and the business situations surrounding the Monday night wars was top notch. Saying he \"encouraged\" or was in any way responsible for a \"dangerous style\" is hyperbole at its worst. He certainly didn\\'t encourage the massive drug scene that killed so many wrestlers.  the only way to get him at all over, is to pair him with dean, and Seth. but then it\\'s not him getting over, it\\'s Dean, and Seth getting over, with Roman as baggage.  \\n\\nas a Singles competitor, he is beyond saving barring massive changes to his character, and booking. he would also have to be gone for at least 2 months. The crowd is simply tired of him at this point. This sounds insane on paper but when you really think about it it makes a lot of sense and it\\'s pretty genius. The main problem TNA has had in the past is coming off as WWE Light. They used a ton of guys who WWE didn\\'t want/need. One of Heyman\\'s best qualities is building stars, or at the very least, making someone appear a much bigger star than they actually are. Hecould have done that with anyone and everyone who was young enough to be presented as fresh.  He\\'s a knockout artist. Karl Anderson SQ- That Randy Cena T-Shirt guy just wants to put himself over! A guy with the worst name ever  a broken *freakin* neck \"and he did a good job commentating\"\\n\\nwas the ONLY point you mentioned commentary. And the way you phrased it makes it seems like it\\'s an added point.\\n\\nI saw your response to Kobe, embarrassing.  Ooooo kingslayer Most fans don\\'t remember Ambrose losing feuds because he\\'s so popular. I myself don\\'t even remember feuds he\\'s lost. Sometimes the character trumps wins/losses. It\\'s true for him.  Reuniting the Shield as heels then having both Dean and Seth turn on Reigns can work.  Oh this was Nash? That explains it. He doesn\\'t like Meltzer because he exposed to a lot of people how bad he was, and what a weak money draw he was. \\n\\nAlso, Nash is a habitual liar. That\\'s not even getting into how he always talks about how much money he has,and yet he\\'s out there doing the retired wrestler schtick in VA halls signing autographs and hocking merch.  Hasn\\'t impressed me in the slightest. He ruined his legacy when he killed his wife and child. Everything went out the window. What does being fat have to do with his character? Its clearly an insult  Video linked by /u/Gamer2332:\\n\\nTitle|Channel|Published|Duration|Likes|Total Views\\n:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:\\n[How a pro handles paparazzi and signing autographs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lg0B0sHJL2w)|Wimp Videos|2014-07-20|0:02:18|115+ (96%)|32,938\\n\\n&gt; American actor Matt Damon arrives at LAX with his family...\\n\\n---\\n\\n[^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/youtubot/wiki/index) ^| [^/u/Gamer2332 ^can ^delete](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=_youtubot_&amp;subject=delete\\\\%20comment&amp;message=dmhr29f\\\\%0A\\\\%0AReason\\\\%3A\\\\%20\\\\%2A\\\\%2Aplease+help+us+improve\\\\%2A\\\\%2A) ^| ^v2.0.0 In NXT yeah. He hasnt done much in nxt but thats more on the booking than him personally. but if you saw him outside of NXT, youd know what im talking about\\n\\nHe had a great match with aleister black on TV a month ago. Thats pretty much the only chance hes had since coming back Awesome news! I\\'m really hoping it will be more on the cheaper side. I look forward to going through some of the old TNA weekly PPVs. \\n\\nOn a side note I\\'m a big fan of old school wrestling review podcasts like OSW Review, AE Podcast, New blood rising podcast, and New generation project podcast. I\\'m hoping with all of the old TNA shows being so easily accessible this will spark more TNA old school review podcasts.  I kept seeing a scary clown face.  Like the dark blue is the clown\\'s eye. &gt;genuine emotion \\n\\n&gt;didn\\'t spam catchphrases every two seconds (BALLGAME notwithstanding)\\n\\n&gt;selling moments\\n\\n&gt;working well with others\\n\\n&gt;all this right after JBL left commentary\\n\\nWhat the fuck else could I be taking about? La Sombra^ Car lender\\'s son. Well done Kevin Owens is one of my favorite wrestlers. He\\'s also fat. It doesn\\'t have to be an insult  no, but you\\'re close Why? The IC and US titles already don\\'t get enough respect. We don\\'t need more belts. Very It\\'s different because the Impact criticism was bringing in guys who had already peaked and already had their shot.\\n\\nThe current NXT approach is to take older guys from smaller promotions who have not yet had a chance on the WWE stage. One could argue they\\'re past their primes, but they haven\\'t been seen in this spotlight yet.\\n\\nEDIT: This difference is also literally [Heyman\\'s exact point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXSTkYSJ3z0&amp;feature=youtu.be)—to establish a company that\\'s different than the others with his youth-based movement. He came to play Would you say kevin owens gimmick is a fat canadian? No. So why say that about kassius? Clearly you were insulting him Uh wrestling? All of those things also deal with wrestling. Emotion, selling, catchphrases and promos, working well with others. Oh fuck off. People oggle over Maryse here but tbh the main reason many others and I love the pair is their chemistry together as dastardly heels. They show they\\'re in love and Maryse will do anything to help Miz win and she has elevated his position as chicken shit heel by a lot. We were actually a really hot crowd this Monday.\\n\\nSo fuck you instead.  JBL\\'s international sports references kept me from feeling alienated in a sea of American triumphalism. His inclusivity towards foreign viewers is something I\\'ll always cherish. The guy is a legend in my book. UNDERTAKER\\n Yeah but is it possible something happened to change the minds of many people on a guy?? Like with Dean and Seth for example, both were universally loved but then fell off a bit thanks to repetitive or boring feuds. We are just now starting to like them again thanks to the reunion. It makes sense that a large number of people could feel the same way about these guys.\\n\\nNakamura, possible that people didn\\'t see his work in NJPW or NXT and so I wouldn\\'t blame them for not liking him because nothing he has done on the main roster has been all that impressive leading to a divide in opinions from 2 very numerous groups. Damn.  Never knew Charlotte was arrested. I must find a mugshot now.  Watching this made me realize Apollo Crews is baby Lashley.  probably a little from column A, a little from column B.\\n\\n\"we dropped the ball with this guy, but on the down low, we\\'re proud he went out and made something of himself\" I don\\'t want Seth and Dean to be use for Roman to get cheered. They had plans, sadly, for only one.\\n\\nI miss blake and murphy\\'s creamy thickness &gt;(BALLGAME)\\n\\nWhen did he ever use that in a normal promo? Never.\\n\\n&gt;selling moments\\n\\nDifferent from normal selling.\\n\\n&gt;I never even mentioned promos\\n\\nI\\'ll give you working well with others. How does this get more upvotes than the DDP AMA? Do they accept payment in GFW gold? Well, I mean, he did \"still got it\". One month free with every purchase of Global Force Gold! tss. tony schiavone syndrome His character is more the foreign underdog scrapping his way up the ladder, but he is big with the girls over there and it\\'s been worked into his character a bit. All three of them would get cheered, I think. Wow it was the same promo , he has such a natural charisma that I\\'ve not seen in a wrestler in a long long time. He and moose have got me back into impact  this is as bad as the shirts with 2 football teams on either side of the shirt.  Have either Murphy or Blake shown up on TV at all this year? I was never too hot on Blake but I think a lot of people agree that Buddy Murphy is a severely underrated talent. i love when guys and girls have teams/stables together Least funniest. Nailed it. If \"Broken\" Matt Hardy has told us anything it\\'s that anyone can turn their career around by simply telling an intriguing story.  \\n\\nThe reason Roman Reigns doesn\\'t have much of a shot is because he\\'s wrestling in the WWE, one of the worse companies ever of their size.  \\n\\nBut the same rules still apply, if they make him interesting, put him in intriguing storylines, create drama and comedy, he\\'d do very well.  \\n\\nIt\\'s just that, WWE stories are all the same.  \"I\\'m gonna beat you up before (or after) our match.\"  \"I\\'m gonna say something mean about you!\"  \"I\\'m gonna talk about how much better a wrestler I am!\"  \\n\\nThese stories are boring.  Nobody will care.   🚨🚨🚨🚨 HES FAT 🚨🚨🚨🚨 They aren\\'t training staff on different employment contracts, they are independent contractors. NXT trainers actually receive comprehensive benefits such as retirement and pension plans, health benefits etc that performers don\\'t. Sara Del Rey/Amato has more job security than Cesaro even if she earns less per annum because she\\'s actually part of WWE corporate, not just considered an independently contracted talent. As such they are also held to a different and slightly higher standard expectation wise.  It\\'s hard to explain. I hardly notice Kevin is fat, and whenever I see Samoa Joe his weight is the last thing that comes to my mind. But for some reason Ohno doesn\\'t have that effect  I do. 8-11 every Monday night. You said Cole Miners, right? Say it ain\\'t so \"Where is he.\" \"Did you check the bags?\" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Hell, some of us write fic about that. Thanks, I\\'ll check these out with some buddies later on. I appreciate the heads up btw and as long as it\\'s not just torture porn stuff like some CZW I\\'m good with hardcore.  Not really a miz fan but I definitely respect what hes accomplished and that hes one of the people who can pull off a shoot while still bein in kayfabe 1- replace the 1st hour of Raw with the cruiserweight division. get rid of 205 live.  \\n2- lower crowd lights to discourage crowd antics.  \\n3- vince no longer has power of veto over everything on the main roster. he is still an important voice, but if the rest of the team thinks his idea is bad or would fuck up a story they\\'re trying to tell, then they can get a majority ruling on it. Yeah.  The fact that wwe 2k18 has such a huge roster from its history but lacks hulk hogan is sad. He said it in the ring virtually every match he ever had haha\\n I wonder if anyone will ever get the rub of being able to bring up Benoit in a promo I want to say Nasty Boy Brian Knobs, but I don\\'t think that is right.  1) Cut the schedule down by a significant amount.  If wrestlers get more rest, they can wrestle harder and we\\'d actually be able to get some \"indie style\" matches.\\n\\n2) Create a belt for people that can\\'t talk.  I don\\'t care what you call it, but have it defended primarily in tournaments and stuff like that, rather than forcing belts into personal feuds.\\n\\n3) Stop giving people actual scripts.  Tell them the gist and let them go.  If they can\\'t ad lib, send them after the \"no talking necessary\" belt.\\n\\n4) I know you said 3, but this is like an alternate version of #2: use more managers for people that can\\'t talk.  Paul Heyman is so good for Brock Lesner.  Why can\\'t Gran Metalik just get a manager, for example?   Ill never understand why they just wouldnt rename it He still has the damn IV thing hanging from his arm! THAT\\'S hardcore! Show\\'sbeard I mean some of the mma guys can actually cut better promos  1) implement a 2 or 3 month off season (tv only). 2). The big 4 ppvs should be quarterly. Wrestlemania in April. Summerslam in July. Survivor Series in October. Royal Rumble in January. 3). Let the wrestlers go off script.   Would it be possible to...jeez...move Byron to Raw, make Booker heel, make tom Face, graves to Smackdown, throw Mauro back in.  Looking real jacked, baby  To be fair: I think if the network started uploading Raw / SD it\\'d feel like daylight robbery to *only* be paying 10 a month.\\n\\nIt\\'s too cheap as it is IMO, the quantity of content is already mad, even if I don\\'t personally watch *that* much of it.  Totally respect Miz for that, but everyone is different. Looking real jacked, baby Jason Jordan had a good showing in the battle royal this week and Miz is supposed to defend at No Mercy so I could see Jordan vs Miz for No Mercy.  I\\'d disagree with your \"if they are in it for the free college they won\\'t last long\". Its no different than being in it to support your family or to get away from whatever your in. \\n\\nMy wife\\'s dad and her step dad both signed up because they knocked a girl up in high school and needed a way to make some cash. They both retired from the military with 20 plus years service.\\n\\nI think some guys thrive in that environment and some guys don\\'t just like every other work place there are probably hundreds of variables that go into if someone makes it or not.  Nobody really liked Miz back then so I\\'m calling bullshit I\\'m a Roman Reigns fan, and this is still an awful idea. I think you\\'re missing the joke a little.\\n\\nAnyone can like dislike anyone they want but the \"sudden\" turns usually cone about as a result of some Meltzer comment.\\n\\nLike, at a PPV everyone is posting about how someone had a good match, within 24 hours Meltzer posts his review and gives it 2 or 3 stars, now everyone says it was awful.\\n\\nOr a generally liked wrestler has some info \"leaked\" by Metlz and people start saying how that person was ALWAYS a bad guy.\\n\\nIt\\'s laughable. Ok.... But Im still curious as to how that makes his gimmick a fat basketball fan? What does being fat have to do with his gimmick  You\\'re not wrong. There\\'s a reason they\\'re good friends.\\n\\nI\\'ll add that Vince, despite a lot of stories about him screwing people also seems to have more respect for the working man, because he actually had to work hard to get where he was despite having a rich dad.\\n\\n Seeing photos of the amount of people waiting outside their hotel in Brooklyn was ridiculous. The airport thing is just sad.  I think WWE will eventually do Sami vs. Neville at Mania, while people complain that Sami\\'s too good for the CW divisoon. His Wrestlemania promo package to that Nas track is still one of my faves ever. I remember a friend who doesnt watch much outside of WM and Royal Rumble became a huge Miz fan from that one package. Heck even the rest of us who were anti Miz at the time started to believe. My money is in seven years everyone is going to be treating Roman the way there are now treating Cena. The Golden Boy who finally after year of toiling away earns respect. This is the same logic as \"you can\\'t criticize wrestling if you\\'re not a wrestler\". Just because someone else\\'s fat doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t say \"dude is fat\\'.  Probably the least drawing gimmick of all time haha.  Steiner promos alone are worth $141 2/3 a month You can see his better-than-Johnny-Mundo abs through that Pancrase shirt.  [](/steiner )\\n\\nS\\'MOA JOE\\'S NEMESIS! [here\\'s some pictures of him doing it](https://www.hugi.is/media/contentimages/67267.jpg)\\n\\nif you know king\\'s moveset, you might be able to tell which moves minoru is doing here Good work, bud.  Man I love just putting someone like Tyler Breeze in a feud with The Rock or Tyler Breeze in a feud with Batista or really just Tyler Breeze in a feud with any legend and having the best roster of all time. I\\'d pay good money to see that. Right. Punk has a very unique personality and I don\\'t think it has jackshit to do with him being an \"indie guy\".  lol getting insulted by someone insulting you isn\\'t getting insulted \"so easy\" what\\'s embarrassing is your lack of logic and lack of integrity. Anyone who reads this will think you\\'re a hypocrite. You call me a retard (a disgusting insult) for ignoring part of your comment yet you ignore all of the parts of mine in which I make you look very foolish. He\\'s not really a \"draw\" but the guy still has a lot of fans even after the backstage heat issue and it would definitely help 205 live a lot.  For a second I thought it was dead since 1979 ;) No. Two different injuries. Detached retina vs broken orbital bone. One is an internal nerve injury, the other is a bone fracture that causes the support under and around the eye to give so the eye sags in the socket and can slip out. This is like comparing a dislocation of the thumb to having your hand smashed with a hammer. An eye can suffer many forms of injury, not all or them similar or concurrent. If Vader had actually pushed his eye back into a detached retinal nerve he\\'d have basically blinded himself in the process by further damaging the nerve with direct impact trauma. Daniel Bryan took three weeks off until his vision stopped being blurry, he didn\\'t jam his eye back. Not at all similar. Matt Hardy and Undertaker have suffered fractured orbital bones though, I believe Austin Aries was the most recent casualty of one.  Especially when that person is a public figure in a cosmetic business.  I honestly only still pay for WWE Network because of NXT stuff. Both weekly TV and Takeovers are worth $120 a year from me IMO. The build can be so-so sometimes, but the climaxes are almost always unbelievable television (especially the past year or so).\\n\\nThe main roster PPVs feel like a chore I have to do so I can come on this sub and be prepared to talk about it.  He was loud and overbearing, spoke over everyone on the announce team and sounded like Foghorn Leghorn. He also made ridiculous obscure references that wouldn\\'t be relavant to anyone but him.\\n\\nAll of his failings off the announce desk aside, I still don\\'t like him. Eh, AJ gave Shane the best match Wrestlemania weekend. Let\\'s not act like this is crazy. Will it be up to the Tozawa / Neville or Aries / Neville matches? No. Will it be awesome with an invested crowd, absolutely.  \"Hey I\\'m just watching like one of the fans right now brother\"\\n\\nHe does get a little annoying on commentary, but Vampiro also has some pretty great moments later in the season. Middle-aged white man asking to be called \"Baby Ali\".  ... like he just didn\\'t care to make the people say \"Oh yeah!\"?  Enzo hasn\\'t really been defined as a singles performer, and the whole point of watching wrestling is to watch characters change. Jericho is saying that it will be Neville\\'s job to make it look like Enzo is worthy of being champion. Try being a Tool fan.  No doubt AJ has a phenomenal dropkick, but Okada is the only guy I\\'ve seen that gets so high, that he appears to be kicking downwards, even when facing opponents that are 6 feet tall.    Around this time, someone said Alexa Bliss was sleeping her way down the ladder, but yet, now she\\'s Women\\'s Champion. I believe that a Shield reunion would get him over but not like this. There must be a bigger threat, almost an Invasion to help him get there. You don\\'t have WCW but you do have the Indies...have an Indie Alliance take over RAW and Smackdown. Have Adam Cole come up with KOR and Fish. Have Ohno, Strong, Roode, Owens, Zayn, Gallows and Anderson team with them. Have them completely take over both shows and, at Survivor Series next year, have Team WWE vs. Team Alliance. There is where you reunite the Shield.\\n\\nLongterm storytelling boys. real talk- the fuck happened with kassius ohno. like i heard he use to look great then he gets signed to nxt- gets fat- gets released cuz his weight problems- heard he trained hard to get in shape again- gets called back to nxt- gets fat again. like is nxt a trigger word that makes him gained 120 pounds? If those guys can kick out, then why  the king of kickouts John Cena will lose with one spear  I think the saying goes \"the bigger they are, the harder they fall\"\\n\\nAsk Big Show after RAW on Monday.  Yeah, everything is just one set recycled now. I miss the claws on the Backlash set.  He is. And likely will stay freelancing for a long time.  That would be cool. Especially if they somehow got Kenny Omega. Lol. His videos are actually pretty well thought out and a lot better than the fantasy booking that goes on around here.  Roman was supposed to beat Rollins. The Ambrose title change was decided upon last minute when word within the company about Romans drug test failure started coming out.\\n\\nThe odds drastically switched to Rollins hours before the show began.\\n\\nWhile I agree Rollins was the right choice, I do believe it wasn\\'t the plan for Ambrose to cash in right away. Leo Kruger/Adam Rose won the FCW Title twice. \\n\\nMan, he deserved so much better than what he got.  Enzu-Shining Wizard? Whenever I hear Meltzer i think of a tuna melt, I eat tuna melt and i become fat. Fuck u David Meltzer I\\'m not, enlighten me please. There\\'s a very good reason why Dean Malenko was never world champion. Dijak/lee is gonna fucking rule, it\\'s very hard for Trevor lee to not kill it in pwg  If I could buy this online I\\'d buy it in a heartbeat  I know it\\'s been said a million times, but I\\'d give just about anything to have this move back Rand Yorton  I\\'d be fine with that. He\\'s an enormous talent. I also wouldn\\'t mind Swann getting that opportunity! I\\'m sure Raven has tried to sue over the Independent Contractor situation at least once. Not sure what happened with it though. Looks just like it was supposed to be a regular Shining Wizard, only unlike Muta, Nak can extend his leg all the way out and is just so goddamned graceful.

Not if his brother Keith has anything to say about that. Last year did 3,000 and 4,000 in Manchester and Birmingham  I\\'m telling you even the hardcore fans that loved ECW the \"smarks\" started turning on ECW by 1998. Wrestlepalooza 98 gets 20 percent thumbs up, November 2 Remember gets TWELVE percent thumbs up. They were losing even their hardcore fans before even 1999.  I would be 100% okay with Blake and Murphy just showing up with their dubstep theme and pretending like nothing happened and they\\'re still a viable tag team.  I\\'m good without that 2 hours a week of decent/good content is better than 5 hours of mostly nothing per week. Sexy post  Have you SEEN a Ric Flair match? Kurt Angle. Lookin real, jacked baby But 205 live is taped after Smackdown on Tuesday. So Cory works 2 days You can be legally blind and still see. The cutoff is 20/200. I am legally blind but can see well enough to get around. I can\\'t drive or see more than a few feet sway from me though. Typically \"blind\" people still have some vision even if the only thing they can see is light and shadow. Yeah I\\'m not faulting you for it. I was just saying its not a gimmick that anyone gets over with. Austin, Rock, Hogan, didn\\'t light the world on fire with \"good wrestler\" gimmick haha :) They were utilised just fine at the time, unfortunately Vince likes his blonde bombshells more than his Val Venis lookalikes.  He forces him to eat the burgers after the match lol jack gallagher better take it easy with those headbutts. I don\\'t think his nose was broken as much as the ladder just slashed his face in half.  It was brutal.  \\n\\nEdit: A letter. ok You have a point, but in my experience with Reddit. When people\\'s opinions go against the status quo, they (myself included), are less likely to join threads and join the conversation, thus leading to more people of the prevailing opinion \\'circle jerking\\' the overall opinion. Which obviously has a snowball effect on the rest of the sub.  Buy it and wear it to RAW in the front row. Funny you should mention Finn. Since I am the \"Slays Pussy Every Knight Like It\\'s His Job Hoot\" of my friends. /s Fuck man, they were a great group. Trips did german suplex that fan. I got Trips Cheaper to keep it simple. What\\'s his best book? I like how some of you are hellbent on turning WWE into your own personal super Indy.  Maybe they should stop running arenas and stadiums.  \\n\\n*Wrestlemania 33 will be moved from the Superdome to the  Louisiana Elks Lounge, Axxess will be at the Holiday Inn on Podryas Street (the Louie Armstrong Balltoom) and there\\'ll be a RAW TV taping following that.*   ? He\\'s no Rob Conway. Says who? I\\'ve literally not heard anything about this until this post, and doing a quick google &amp; twitter search, NOBODY is saying anything about tjp being released, so no That\\'s how much I paid for my kids birth in the US. Neat. Jacked baby looking real Unfortunately as a former champion, it\\'s hard to put him in that slot. I think they should start exporting talents in and out of the division. With Swann, Kendrick, and TJP leading the charge. Swann should be an IC Title Contender in my view. Its still real to me damnit!  The guy who runs a traveling variety show has contributed more to the world than the President of the United States. Got it.  News to me but not surprising there were rumors he had heat when he first debuted for comments. Haven\\'t heard anything lately tho. I don\\'t think its a big deal if he is I don\\'t recall the last time I saw him on TV (no I don\\'t watch 205) W T H did you just say? ...I want that so fuckin bad. I really need to sign up for their fan club so I can go to one of these events. It\\'s on my bucket list. I miss Blake and Murphy existing.  Is it wrong to want professional athletes to look like they actually work out? A E S T H E T I C S Yeah, it happened to Raven. The guy pulled him out of the ring (while Raven was doing his corner sit-down promo thing he always used to do) The first time he gave them a 5 star match  WOOOO Is.... is that a real shirt? Bryan Danielson vs KENTA in ROH from Manhattan in 2006 where Bryan had his shoulder taped up was phenomenal.  So...is there a new La Parka? First, the WWE has been going DOWN in ratings for the last decade. It\\'s just that they STARTED so high from their boom periods, that they\\'re able to keep themselves alive. If ANY other company did what they\\'ve been doing, they\\'d go under in MONTHS.\\n\\nSecond, John Cena\\'s success outside of WWE can largely be contributed to Cena himself.\\n\\nThird, I can talk about how poor the writing has been for more more than half those people you just mentioned.\\n\\nSecond, Vince may be an excellent business man. but this is a company that \"creates characters &amp; tells stories\" and he is quite possibly the WORST writer of all time.\\n\\nRemember in the Attitude Era?\\n\\nVince: \"Hey! I have this revolutionary idea! You know how we normally have cookie cutter good guys and bad guys? What if we did this cool new thing and gave them... nuance and depth!\"\\n\\nEvery Other Writer in the World: \"...yes, we figured out that was a good idea a few centuries ago.\" Zayn and Balor are two good fits but it\\'d be \"below\" them due the state of the division currently. :-/ did you just pluck this from thin air? if it is even remotely true, just because one person is released doesnt signify the division is \" going away \" they will more than likely just call up someone from NXT Offensive/defensive linemen in football work out. Sumo wrestlers work out. Ohno actually has a medical disorder, but that isnt the point. Not everyone has to be cut from stone  I\\'ve repackaged Luke Harper similar to an early version of Big Bossman and am loving it - he\\'s a month or two away from a serious top push. Zack Ryder has been repackaged as a sleezeball and The New Day have gone off the deep end as \"Booty Nation\", an over-the-top comedic re-enactment of the Nation of Domination. Sami and Seth are teaming with a Bad Influence meets Road Warriors gimmick, Reigns is champion and ripping off the Reignmaker persona, and Dean Ambrose is the best contender but is being withheld title shots.\\n\\nI\\'ve also repackaged Bushwhacker Butch as a Eugene-esque mega fan. His mannerisms and moveset make it a bit offensive at times. I might drop this after his upcoming title match against Reigns. You mean you don\\'t want Dean \"I\\'m here to take the beating for Roman\" Ambrose back ? Only good thing that iteration of him brought us was the match against HHH at Roadblock. It\\'s by no means exclusive to wrestling. Just a stylistic choice in Japan. A lot of bands do that too as well as tons of random things. \\n\\nI teach English, and it\\'s an uphill battle to tell kids not to write ONE PIECE or Tokyo SKYTREE.  Jesus, he\\'s lookin jacked.\\n\\nBig Dick Meltzer is ready to throw them snowflakes for tonight\\'s matches and all the stars at the main event. Even in Grassroots rugby they have clear cut concussion protocol. There\\'s been 2 occasions this year that I\\'ve had concussion test administered by our team physician after awkward tackles that left me dazed. Last year after I got knocked out during a muay thai fight my rugby coach wouldn\\'t let me play for 2 weeks, and I had to get a doctor\\'s certificate indicating that there was no lasting issue. Minoru Suzuki.  I like that you didn\\'t give a single source or mention of this in your post classic Nandos with the harm~~less~~^ful rib You missed the three weeks in NICU and emergency major surgery.\\n\\nI suppose it\\'s possible you have coverage that would absorb it, and your employer pays the deductible. But if so you\\'re the exception. I\\'m not. Just look at me.... Yep.\\n\\nThe homeless guy who squeegees my window in traffic has contributed more to the world than POTUS. \\n\\nThe bar is REAL low these days. The dingus who wrote \"Bawitdaba\" is running for Senate.  One of them is having a kid with a former Tough Enough winner and the other is just... Somewhere in NXT. A great TV show like American Gods did about 700k on a bigger station dude. LU does about 200K in their good days (even though they are phenomenal). 300somethingK is very good. What does being liberal even have to he with being a dick? Why does everyone always bring someone\\'s political views into this type of shit? WE STAY LAID Ain\\'t I a sight to see... +1 for Social Outcasts Okada vs Omega 1,2, and 3 But that makes it so much more believable.  Remember when that guy had an entrance in his entrance that was in an entrance? Read that last Winter and really loved it. My cousin got it for me for Christmas and I was pleasantly surprised!  Shelton Benjamin coming out as a gardener confirm [Does someone have a magnifying glass?](https://media.tenor.com/images/dcb4cb85355e4291010abe6245d51773/tenor.gif) What? No, if I stalk you at the airport you owe me your fucking autograph. /s My favorite wrass-lor, Rand Yorton Greatest of all Time.  I hate ziggler and love miz now. 5 years ago me would never understand this. Sadly, I doubt it. It\\'s a tiny operation, I doubt more than 6 people are actually involved, including Minoru. I wish he\\'d open a pro-wrestling tees store, Hiroyo Matsumoto has one and she\\'s always hanging with him. no they dont I hope there was a safe-word. Yeah and those guys are like 300lbs+ and a lot of that is muscle.\\n\\n If Ohno was as big as those guys it would believable, but right now it is not. \\n\\n Ohno is billed as 6\\'4, 270lb. There are no 6\\'4, 270lb guys in any sport right now carrying that much visible fat.\\n If Hogan would\\'ve come back to the WWF in 97 it would\\'ve been a colossal disaster. \\n\\nHe already had problems with Bret before Hogan left for WCW, they wouldn\\'t have gotten along. Stone Cold had problems with him in WCW when Hogan (among others) wouldn\\'t let him get above a certain level and you just know Hogan would\\'ve done something to squander Stone Cold becoming the mega star he did. Not to mention Shawn Michaels was in the peak of attitude problems that would\\'ve been at odds with Hogan\\'s cuntiness.\\n\\nThank God Hulk didn\\'t return until 2002. So what are you saying?\\n I highly disagree with Toronto. One of the weaker Asuka NXT matches and a just fine main event with Nakamura and Joe, probably the worst of their matches together. Only real saving grace of it was the tag title match, which was amazing. Probably one of the weaker Takeovers, IMO. I am somewhat more of s fan of 29, 30, and 31 tbh\\nYou got the shield and Punk/Taker matches in 29\\nThe DB storyline in 30\\nAnd finally the cash in, ladder match, and Rusev match in 31 You don\\'t want to make this tread political but you put Donald Trump and a FUCKING MURDERER in the same category. Jesus Christ. Lookin real jacked, Davey Was that the show where they also had a live event scheduled for the same night for some reason? I don\\'t remember the Ryback promo exactly but I do remember this show. 1. Kazuchika Okada vs Kenny Omega - Dominion 6.11\\n2. Kenny Omega vs Tetsuya Naito - G1 Climax Finals\\n3. Kazuchika Okada vs Katsuyori Shibata - Sakura Genesis TIL OP\\'s opinion of Enzo has nothing to do with Enzo\\'s performance.   The WWE Kiss-ass army is.  I\\'m stealing this. He\\'s already the second-best wrestler in the company behind AJ. \\n\\nOne man\\'s opinion anyways.  That\\'s WM 22........  Wow. I\\'ve never noticed that before. I didn\\'t see a whole lot of Muta\\'s run on top but I definitely saw enough that I should\\'ve noticed that. Unreal. I\\'m an idiot. \\nThanks.  One the great ROH feuds. I still remember Lacey smack-talking them behind their backs, and then Whitmer showing up on the next show going, \"You think I don\\'t watch the DVDs?\" and kicking her to the curb. I would personally say the shitty things that are known about Vince outweigh the good things. He\\'s done some cool shit, and he\\'s done some disgustingly awful shit. I don\\'t think you have to sum anyone up as \"a heart of gold\" or \"the devil\". \\n\\nEach person has to look at the shit he\\'s done good and bad and decide for themselves how they view him.  Exporting the talent is a good idea. Would certainly add some fresh faces to the midcard scene.  I am, and I think it\\'s fantastic. However with NOAH shows it can be as far as 2 months behind. I think it\\'s still only up the end of July. Takeover fatal 4 way is in my opinion the best because it had one of the best fatal 4 way matches in recent years OP\\'s account is just 6 days old. Any Japanese wrestling that airs that isn\\'t available behind a streaming service is uploaded by the group. Have you not paid attention to anything he\\'s said at all? I think it would be best to look up the memes/commonly assumed themes as they come to you.  You might not fully understand what appeals to you and there may be more to wrestling that you might enjoy but haven\\'t been exposed to, yet    \\n   \\nAre there any particular details/performers that hooked you?  Knowing that might help folks figure a direction to point you in.  There\\'s a LOT to be seen.   /s, please Is everyone supposed to be a cartoon character? Is it 1994 again? He got the loudest pop I\\'ve ever heard on 205 just by being there, after one of the most dead Smackdown crowds ever. \\n\\nBetween his skill on the mic, his huge merch movement and being overwhelmingly over with the kids, thinking he\\'s \"no draw\" is delusional. Believe the OP gif was an attempt at a safe recreation of this botch. Jobber since day one-ish. They will always be the Dubstep Cowboys to me Batista ??? \\n\\nBatista said he doesn\\'t want to wrestle and said if he has one more match, he wants to have it against HHH. \\n\\nBatista is only rumored to headline HOF What I read said Staten Island did 1100. The first (and, thus far, only) one was at BOLA last year. The Meltzer Driver far predates that. I disagree. People liked Cena for most of his career before they turned on his schtick. He had long since earned his spot before he started getting booed. And the reasons they get booed are largely different. \\n\\nIf things continue the way they do, there\\'s no chance in hell Roman is gonna be anywhere near the top in seven years.  Oh yeah, then we can have No Way Jose come out going \"Such no, much way. Wow\"\\n\\nNo more memes in wrestling please. Miz is a legitimate A-Lister, the most must see superstar in WWE! Matt Damon? Please. Let me know when he stars in something the caliber Marine 5: Battleground.  Big Daddy V was all jiggle though. His gimmick was being fat. Is Ohno\\'s gimmick being fat? Do people call him fat and make fun of him in promos for being fat? My thoughts exactly. Right now you\\'re watching the E, to me thats like a new born pup whos eyes arent open yet. The moment yours are youll be like WTF what have i been doing with my life Now that I\\'ve thought about it more, there was a lot of good stuff in 2015. I got to see Seth vs Bryan at a house show (not really relevant to anyone else but my favorite WWE memory), WM31 and particularly the Seth run-in that I caught not long after coming home from vacation, Owens vs Cena at MITB, and as disappointing as it was in some aspects, I still enjoyed Taker vs Brock. It\\'s just that the worst of 2015 happened at the end of the year with Seth blowing out his knee and Roman\\'s title win and subsequent awful booking, so that\\'s all that comes to mind immediately. Isn\\'t the what DB\\'s gimmick is on Southpaw Regional Wrestling? PM me I would love to talk wrestling in long form.  I have a great knowledge of the history of wrestling. NXT is really good but you could easily catch up watching the last couple of Takeovers and save yourself watching the weekly show https://youtu.be/sOylfJWyLaA My current wish is to have more currency than I currently have so I could by such an item.

Plus it\\'s just over used and boring. Dude,  that\\'s like super gay THIS IS THE GREATEST NIGHT IN OUR SUB\\'S HSTORY It\\'s epic in its poor representation of everything on that magnificent shirt.  Is he working face or heel at house shows? The real problem with his weight is it that hasn\\'t changed his gear to match. He looks like he\\'s wearing clothes that are too small and it makes him look like a slob.  I\\'d say move Graves to Smackdown and put Lawler on Raw, if he\\'s even interested in the position anymore. And Enzo and Cedric had some good chemistry during their tag match on 205 last week. I think Enzo could help Cedric get over. WeeLC was good. This TJP hate is getting old. It’s like most people hate him because it’s cool to do so.  His growth in WWE will be limited sure if H cant move past it. Remember, he has health issues that pertain to his weight, cant blow pass that Fellow Wichitan! I couldn\\'t go because I had rehearsal for a play. Glad to see the 316 on here! he\\'s been catching everyone recently. Miz, Owens, Cena, Enzo, and if you want to count Jericho since he is off and on right now. Eli is def up there though and I could probably buy the argument of him being top 5.  That\\'s good stuff, Chip.  *Oh you didn\\'t know?*\\n\\n*Your ass better caaaaaaaaaaall somebodeeeeeeeyyyy*\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, D-generation X, proudly brings to you, its the ~~WWF~~ WWE **TAG** **TEAM** **CHAMPIONS** **OF** **THE** **WOOOOOOOOOOORLD**...*THE ROAD DOGG*, *JESSIE JAMES*, *THE BADASS*, *BILLY GUN*, THE NEW **AGE** **OUTLAWS**.

Thanks, glad people enjoy them. I highly recommend buying the iPPV. I have my own patreon, but I won\\'t entertain you as much as CMLL\\'s Gran Prix will. I\\'m hoping to make some video/audio content soon. Which I would probably post here, so stay tuned! Murphy hasn\\'t been on TV since Samoa Joe murdered both him and Blake, but Blake was on TV a few months ago to job out to Drew McIntyre. Might\\'ve been the episode after Chicago. So is his gimmick trying to hide his fat? \\n\\nWhen I think of fat in wrestling I think Earthquake, Typhoon and Yokozuna. Those guys owned the size they were and weren\\'t ashamed of it.   Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute, fuzzy little man peach. When has Jinder wrestled Psycho Sid? I don\\'t have an exact number but the people I remember going down to NXT are Cesaro, Tyson Kidd, Cameron, Alex Riley, Brodus Clay, Mason Ryan, Camacho, Hunico, Curtis Axel, Jinder Mahal, Natalya, Justin Gabriel, Tamina, Alicia Fox, The Usos, Drew McIntyre... And a lot of other guys actually. Holy shit the list is long. Is that Sawyer Fulton? Ohh right they both used a song called Big Time.  I guess this means that the ghost of Masa will be managing Hangman Page in NXT. For a lot of people it\\'s cheaper to not have insurance. Why pay for something that isn\\'t needed when hospitals have very generous financial aid guidelines ( I have worked for a major health care network in the mid west for 9 years )  Underrated as in flying under the radar.  I could accept it more easily if they hadn\\'t destroyed Enzo\\'s credibility vs Cass.\\n\\nI could believe Neville could beat Cass. Enzo shouldn\\'t be competitive with him, within storyline or it really makes the entire division look bad. Was he?  I\\'m happy to admit I\\'m wrong. I probably haven\\'t seen it since that night so you know how that goes I believe it\\'s \"guy who used to be Chris Hero\"  &gt;[**PSYCHO SID vs. JINDER MAHAL [11:51]**](http://youtu.be/Ps1g8zahkgA)\\n\\n&gt;&gt;PSYCHO SID vs JINDAR MAHAL\\n\\n&gt; [*^THE ^HANNIBAL ^TV*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcpWZrbYzye7-FY4i1ALfVw) ^in ^Sports\\n\\n&gt;*^40,875 ^views ^since ^Oct ^2013*\\n\\n[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) The Juice is eternally loose in International Caboose \\'The man of 1000 back-breakers\\' Jeff Hardy vs Miz? Omega/Okada II\\n\\nShibata/Okada\\n\\nOmega/Okada I How would you use them? Miz is a phenomenal worker. He\\'s made the IC title more relevant then it has been in years. Thats this monday The very last item in the entire aisle in my local K-Mart\\'s Toy Section today... Hiromu\\'s scrapbook with pics of Dragon Lee in it was legendary  And then he\\'ll beat the shit out of you. C\\'mon, it\\'s Minoru Suzuki, he likes murdering people. I think that method makes the most sense. They do a good job mixing Enzo in with the 6 man tag match last week (usually I hate the Cruiserweight Division 6 man tags because they\\'re just treated as filler). \\n\\nIf they wanted to be meta, they could have Enzo playing the Mayweather role of dodging &amp; exhausting Neville, while eventually getting Neville so frustrated that he makes a mistake that costs him the match. But that would require Enzo to be able to pull that off.  Though the quote escapes me, \"and I see it on eBay\" reminds me of the line Punk said about people selling those collector\\'s cups on Ebay. Huh. What a weird world this is. I could care less if people think Balor is above the cruiserweights. I\\'d rather see him compete for the champion against Neville instead of getting stuck in pointless feuds with Elias and Bray when he probably won\\'t get any titles any time soon. Do they actually check eBay? Can confirm. Have had several kidney stones due to poor diet choices. Went to the hospital on 3 separate occasions (each one about 6 months apart). The running total is about six grand. Standard CAT scan, IVs, all that good stuff. AND THEN THEY SEND ME HOME WITH A STRAINER TO PISS IN. They don\\'t really do anything to help, because as long as you\\'re physically able to pass them, they\\'re going to let you pass them on your own. \\n\\nSo I\\'m not going back to a hospital unless I\\'m missing limbs.  Nah Dubstep cowboys baybay! Wish I was that guy\\'s face I\\'d agree in regard to many/most of the other pro-wrestling specific lingo, but \"the boys\", specifically, seems to breach other cultures a bit too much for me to think it\\'d bother people that much.  \\n  \\nI could be wrong.   That gimmick was almost as non-sensical as MexAmerica based plans can change daddy 🍆💦 Now ya know...Jericho  WWE cares above all else and that\\'s all that matters. We are definitely in agreement, though. Daniel Bryan\\'s entrance theme with the crowd chanting yes? He has not. I wouldn\\'t mind Dakota and Asuka kicking each other into smithereens.  You need to learn what libel is my friend. My opinion that JBL has done more for humanity than you ever will is an opinion and not a form of libel. You accusing JBL of using a charity to line his own pockets is not an opinion, but rather an accusation. That is libel.\\n\\nNot that I spect you to be able to comprehend the difference. Observer has it at 650, which is probably from the venue itself, and Wrestlezone estimated 500.\\n\\nBut look at this video and tell me if you think 1100 people are there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRMaRsD2wDM This is incredible insight. Ric Flair\\'s greatest attribute is making it look like every single one of his opponents can beat him. He made  on everyone look like a credible contender to the champion. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not on Enzo too, it just means there is a certain responsibility on the champion too. Besides, if the champ always makes his opponents look like gold yet keeps winning, then the champ looks that much more unbeatable.  Incase that is your honest opinion, could you explain why you feel that way? The question is: What is exactly WWE doing with Kassius Ohno? It seems like they\\'re going nowhere with him. Oh, is this the new thing now? Dumbass rumors about TJP?  I\\'ll check my sources  I\\'m legitimately puzzled ... well, I\\'m **sold**. I assume this is fake.  I Googled it earlier. **Naito Vs Omega** (This match just felt so huge. Omega knows he can beat Okada but needs to win so he can do it again for the belt. Naito is a 3 count away from finally having that WK main event and get the opportunity to exorcise the demons of his past. If either man loses, after coming so close to completing their storied journey, everything falls apart)\\n\\n**Omega Vs Okada 1** (My favourite from the trilogy. The story of Omega trying to hit the OWA was great. Such an epic encounter and I think I will look at this one more fondly than Dominion simply because I think, like a lot of people, Naito Vs Tanahashi for the IC belt was the big anticipated match, with a lot more of a story going in, but this match stole the show and shook the wrestling world)\\n\\n**Tanahashi Vs Naito from the G1** (I love the pacing and drama in this match. These two have great matches with each other on command but this one was just perfectly executed and layed out) When someone is over as enzo is on a show with a dead crowd 99% of the time you put them in the main event whether they\\'re a great worker or not Ok so, there are 102 active wrestlers on the Raw and Smackdown rosters (Cruiserweights included).\\n\\n*49 spent time in NXT (48%).\\n\\n*29 exclusive to NXT (28%).\\n\\n*20 have also spent time in other developmental territories (19%).\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nRaw:\\n\\n*58 active wrestlers, including cruiserweights.\\n\\n*26 spent time in NXT (44%).\\n\\n*16 exclusive to NXT (27%).\\n\\n*10 spent time in other developmental territories (17%).\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nSmackdown:\\n\\n*44 active wrestlers.\\n\\n*23 spent time in NXT (52%).\\n\\n*13 exclusive to NXT (29%).\\n\\n*10 spent time in other developmental territories (22%).\\n\\nEDIT: I did not count people like Cesaro, Jinder Mahal, and Sin Cara who spent time on NXT TV after their main roster debuts. I considered them to be more of a \"star power\" to help NXT during its early days. Sad that this has to be said. Okada vs Omega 2\\n\\nOkada vs Omega 1\\n\\nOmega vs Naito I\\'m pretty sure Dana wouldn\\'t rush into a relationship with anyone after her boyfriend passed away just a couple weeks ago. Fucking Christ this is turning into shitpost city Oldest ride, longest line.  I think he should establish himself in the division a while before going for Neville  HE SAID ANAL BLEEDING That\\'s what I\\'m seeing on Twitter  So Corpus Christi every show? As a big Spider-Man fan, I really enjoyed Leo Kruger\\'s Kraven the Hunter-esque gimmick. I\\'m sad it never took off. I need to see Dragon Lee in Los Ingobernables. I want to see him tag with Hiromu.\\n\\nI just imagine instead of tagging normally they just give each other a hard slap to the chest. I get that, it just makes no sense. In the case of carrying a bag full of things to autograph, I don\\'t even think they\\'re fans. They\\'re opportunists looking to make money off of annoying exhausted wrestlers. Watch WM X7. All of it. It\\'s probably the best show ever put together. RR 2000 is (my pick) for a close second. Also watch Hulk v Rock at WM X8. \\n\\nI\\'d also recommend watching anything that involves Mick Foley, Terry Funk, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Steve Austin, and The Rock. For the women, dig around for some of Trish\\'s stuff. There\\'s a lot of crap, but her big matches with Victoria, Mickie, and Lita are great. \\n\\nAlso watch wrestling isn\\'t wrestling on the utub. It\\'s fucking awesome. \\n\\nThere are tons of good lists on this sub as well. \\n\\nThat\\'s just stuff off the top of my head, but I\\'m on mobile and don\\'t want to write a book.  I would love to see it too, simply because he\\'s never pulled it off on TV before. Just hope he doesn\\'t brain himself again.  What is one thing you want to learn off the top of your head? Dude that\\'s not a steal. My old roommate who lives in Oregon said that the one of the local dispensaries was selling grams of weed for $3 each. Typically weed is sold for $10-15, but for $3?! Damn that\\'s not even a steal. That\\'s like a net loss but a gain in a loyal customer  jooking beal lacked raby  The battle royal was to face Miz on next Raw episode but not to face Miz  at no mercy\\n\\nNo mercy no 1 Contender\\'s might be different if Miz retains on Raw\\n\\nIf Jeff wins then Jeff vs Miz at no mercy Look at how Gallows and Anderson have been booked.  Looked at Joe Hennig\\'s WWE run in totality. Agreed. I really want an Aussie male push. So ill give you the real answer why this is common with HHH produced events. \\n\\nAt MSG a long time tradition for main event fights is that every light in the arena is turned off besides the halogen lights illuminating only the 2 competitors. For some reason HHH loves the concept and uses it when he feels the event is history making.\\nAt the most recent take over he tried to put a modern spin on it and tried to create a new look and used white led\\'s for the asuka/ember match, but decided against it after the introductions and before the bell rang he put the halogens back on them. \\nJust like vince, HHH has his little things he likes.  Meltzer said \"Ummm, uhhh, it\\'s like, you know, things could...umm, uhh, things could change\"\\n\\nOh fuck, wrong sub, sorry.  Thanks?  \\n\\nI just see it as a side effect of fame - is it disrespectful?  Of course.  Is it wrong?  Probably.  But that\\'s part of the deal.  Sasha wants be a household international star but she wants the people who will power that fame to treat her exactly as requested and ensure her comfort at all times.  It\\'s just not how fame works.  It\\'s not how humans work.   Well, if you get technical about it Enzo won the feud with Big Cass, he \"won\" his last match with the big lummox. However even if Enzo is immediately the most popular wrestler on the cruiserweight roster, he shouldn\\'t immediately go after the title. Give him a few low level singles feuds to adapt to singles wrestling, hone his skills a little bit and build him up in kayfabe. Then he goes after Neville\\'s title.  I heard a cinnamon roll is replacing JBL.  YOU WANT SOME? *hiss* Oh sure. I didn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t worth it to EVERYONE. Just me based on how much I use it. I sign up for a month of WWE network around the Takeovers and/or something special is on (like now with the MYC). Otherwise I don\\'t subscribe. I\\'m like that with most services honestly. I did DDT for a month for Peter Pan and then cancelled. I did Floslam once for an Evolve I wanted to see. \\n\\nThe only services I keep on autopay on a monthly basis are NJPWWorld and Stardom-World.... And F4W if you count that. How would they help Alexa though ? They can\\'t really do anything physical , they barely let Flair do anything physical for Charlotte(which resulted in many dumb finishes with her opponents looking like morons) and when he did everyone got their panties in a bunch because he kissed Becky before them . Why get it signed by Cena when the text clearly state that that\\'s Randy Orton?  It\\'s not like Cena is in the picture or anything.  Can\\'t even tell he\\'s there. There\\'s a promotion that gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Hulk Hogan and you pick Neville v Sami as your favorite of all time? \\n\\nlol  Not only are you a bad shitposter, your username is dumb as fuck. Well, if you really miss him, just get a buddy to scream about Stan Hansen and Big Match John to you while you try to watch Smackdown. There is some truth to your statement but some one always has to lose and someone has to be left off the show. Oh god, Dean\\'s gunna turn huh? Get tickets to the show live, buy the DVD in a few weeks, or check it out on highspots in like a year or more. Let\\'s see what Milo himself has to say on the matter:\\n\\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nero How would you explain Blake and Murphy\\'s absence? People came to the bingo hall to see Sandman Being top draws doesn\\'t mean your matches can\\'t fly under the radar. That\\'s not an automatic association.  Are you calling Uncle Dave a... jacked baby? I think he did a show or 2 before he was off to film a movie and thankfully replaced by Booker T. Watch 31 but then stop before the main event. It was mediocre at best, imo, and Rollins completely saved it  I don\\'t use wrestler lingo I think it is disrespectful to do because I am not a wrestler. Cause you never hear the story that Roman is a swell bloke so he\\'s getting a push It was my favorite for about an hour until DB v Cena happened  In the Battle Of The Leg-Day Fiends... It is true that Enzo came out on top because Big Cass got injured, although the impression that I was left with was how Enzo constantly got Big Show to fight his fights for him. I suppose it helps that the last impression Enzo left was being willing to fight him in a no-DQ match, and won by injuring him. I suppose it depends on what impression it left on their target audience.\\n\\nI agree about not going directly after the title. I\\'m fine with them planting seeds at the moment, but I think he should interact with the rest of the roster first (like he did in that 6 man tag last week). Aries quit because he wasn\\'t on The Neville Level.  Unlike you, most fans don\\'t need everything spelled out to them by promoters. Your \"definition\" of kayfabe is the kind that only applies to the really young or impressionable fans. Wrestling fans by and large are not as easily worked as you are, my friend. OBSERVE THIS BROTHER Jesus Christ 9 downvotes because you don\\'t like someone from the same people who Bitch about creative trying to force us to like someone  lol no It was because the suit and mask was a total piece of shit. He could barely move, see or breathe in that attire. Yes It really was stupid to have Christian lose the ECW title on the last show, he pretty much carried the show during the run. Jeff Hardy vs Miz. Miz cheats to win. Hardy feuds for a few weeks and challenges at No Mercy. \\n\\nOr Jeff wins and Miz rematches at No Mercy.  Very interesting! I think it\\'s all about the feet. He was thrown over the top rope (I\\'m assuming) and his feet never left the apron.\\n\\nI could be wrong thinking that\\'s how it works, but it\\'s a house show and WWE usually changes their rules as they see fit. Has Big Money Meltz been pumping iron so he can debut, wrestle a 7 star match with Okada, and retire? Good lord, he\\'s *still* the champ? That\\'s embarrassing... Heath Slater wins the Universal Title, 3MB reunites as the most dominant stable WWE has ever seen. 3MB go on to beat Triple H, Brock Lesnar and John Cena at Wrestlemania. Bring back Hornswoggle as 3MB\\'s heavy and have him go over Roman Reigns. Wasn\\'t he actually in good shape around this time too lol? He had wrestled shirtless in TNA. Oh, shit, you\\'re right.  I remember smirking at one of their posts before.   How\\'s your body now a few weeks in?\\n\\nAre you already living in pain? Disrespecting your opponent makes it fun. How boring would wrestling be without promos? It\\'s all about the trash talk, you might think you would prefer a peaceful fight, but the only reason you even watched Mayweather/McGregor is probably because of the atmosphere they built out of cutting promos. If it wasn\\'t for that you would never have heard of the fight like this  Ah, so you\\'re one of the \"I ignore facts\" type of people. Good to know.\\n\\nRead, maybe you will learn something: http://www.kff.org/state-category/health-coverage-uninsured/ I\\'d say post one each day.  the reading of the cue cards ruins it for me. You can\\'t see snek. Man, you either lack imagination or are just dense. Do you often read Twitter things in a straightforward monotonous way? This is funny. Was just watching this on YouTube about a month ago. I remember how terrible these songs were back then. These are very terrible today, but I can\\'t help but listen to them all anyway.  My favorite match is Austin VS Hogan, which never happened. Kota Ibushi\\'s rap sheet of crazy things he\\'s done in DDT \\n\\n* Fought Yoshikiko to defend the KO-D Openweight title.\\n* Brawled various places like construction sites, factories, shopping malls, rock festivals, theme parks.\\n* Gave Michael Nakazawa a piledriver swirlie at Ryogoku (Sumo hall)\\n* Moonsaulted off a Nippon Budokan balcony to get permabanned status.  So glad Dakota made it through. \\n\\nI can\\'t remember the bracket off the top of my head, and I\\'m trying very hard to avoid spoilers, but I hope she gets an even better showing next match.\\n\\nIt was a real treat to get to see her live while she was in Australia. Okada vs Omega, Dominion\\n\\nOkada vs Omega, Wrestle Kingdom\\n\\nTaichi vs Taka Michinoku, BOSJ Bret Hart vs British Bulldog from SummerSlam 1992 counts if we count Bulldog being under the influence the entire match. i kinda like having him around he never ceases to amaze me &gt; AJ gave Shane the best match Wrestlemania weekend.\\n\\nThe best night of the night sure, but of the weekend? No way, it was barely even top 5 for me (assuming we\\'re including Monday and Tuesday as well). It\\'s a steep fall from there, the Neville level is beveled  He\\'s like a mascot. Im surprised Punk even still has a dick at this point. After three years of this sub jerking it nonstop you\\'d think it would\\'ve gotten torn off by now. She will face aussie Rhea Ripley in next round. Aussie-Kiwi arch rivalry will ensue.  Cheap seats are better, man. Screw floor seats if you aren\\'t sitting first 3 rows.  Really had to reach for that one Huh? It was me all along.  &gt;Psicosis\\n\\nYou mean Hypnosis? Damon handled that much better than I would. If they wanted me to sign one or two, then fine, but anything more than that, and I would want an explanation for what the others were for. If it was for family or somebody that unfortunately wasn\\'t there themselves, then okay, but if it\\'s just being put on eBay, then one or two is all they get. It might seem cold, but I have no patience for people who want to get cheap cash by doing things like that. Which match did Cena have that giant elbow in? Episode no???? Corgan and Lil Wayne sound a lot alike. I\\'m not kidding. Go listen.  Was clearly a shot at (M)auro (R)anallo Tons of respect for this guy. Reading about where he came from and achieving the biggest dream (getting into WWE) and staying there is the best achievement anyone and every do.\\n\\nYou\\'re awesome Miz.  The BIG **DAWG Thats exactly what a gypsie would say Christian sucks thats why Shawn has lazy eye? Well yeah but he also bitches about KO all of the time. Not much of a draw per say, but the numbers ain\\'t lying considering Vince loves the Youtube numbers each 205 video Enzo is on has been the highest viewed ever since the premise of the show. [ok] (http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/476/418/0ae.jpg) It was a reference to you  &gt;than be the best wrestler in the world  \\n  \\nI don\\'t see what the other stuff has to do with him NOT being the best wrestler in the world... I just \"Goddamn\" in Masahiro chono\\'s voice when i read this But I thought Christian was your saviour? fuck off yelissa &gt; well nobody cares about the work.\\n\\nYou might be right, but at that point, there\\'s no point to the Crusierweight Division if people don\\'t care about the work. The point of giving Crusierweights their own division is to let them have a different match style.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I could see it drawing attention to the division, but if they lose the technical quality of 205 Live, there really would be absolutely no point to watching it.\\n\\nIf they did it right, it could certainly work, but man, I could see this being a disaster. \"People are shitty to famous people, so no one should want success unless they\\'re totally cool with being treated like a pleasure robot.\"\\n\\nOr maybe people could just be less shitty. I\\'d actually get it if they charged like 5-7 a month, just to watch the olden days when they didn\\'t both suck and blow.  KAZE NI NARE! Oh, you\\'re one of those. It is what it is Sure when Lashley takes on 10 cheeseburgers he\\'s an athlete, but when I do it they call me a fatass.  Is that where we got \"A DILAPIDATED BOAT\"? If so, that shit needs to go on the next Voyager probe. Visually muscular  (1)Four(1) It\\'s edit together :( he must of had a hard time doing the video .  Oh shit. Now I don\\'t know who to go for. Do I stay true to Australia and follow Rhea, someone I\\'ve never seen wrestle before the MYC, or Dakota, because I\\'ve been a fan of hers for a while.\\n\\nI guess I shouldn\\'t give up allegiance just because someone from the same country has rocked up. I\\'m just happy one of them is guaranteed to go through. Okada vs. Omega III, G1 Climax\\n\\nOmega vs. Naito, G1 Finals\\n\\nOkada vs. Shibata, Sakura Genesis Ruthless Aggression was so much better than the shitty era we have now. Wrestling nowadays is so sad ,__, FIIIIVE \"Well, like, plans can change, but I\\'m, uh, a white boy and, uh, you know I\\'m jacked, so, you know, deal with it.\" 5 🖐🏻 The difference is you accidentally met him. You didnt intentionally figure out when &amp; which airport he was going to be at to get his pic/sign. The title of this thread is enough for me. If you need an explanation, you\\'re a stalker. You have to have lots of imagination and let the matches play themselves out to create the story.   If they get NOAH on it, I\\'m so in That\\'s . . . so much better. Hmmm that\\'s odd, because I\\'m almost positive he swore up and down they didn\\'t ban it and it was for other reasons. It\\'s almost like wrestlers lie on Twitter to save face. He\\'s a pro wrestler now I feel your pain. One stone reduced me from a man to a child throwing a tantrum in the ER, then into an infant until they pushed dilaudid (after morphene didn\\'t make a dent.) Wouldn\\'t wish that hell on my worst enemy. This comment\\'s not lookin real jacked baby GFW first has to convince me to watch them for free before I pay money for the pleasure....and outside of the internet, I haven\\'t seen a lick of advertising for them I think saying he was gonna glow like a fool was a shot at Naomi  I\\'ve got vision as bad as he does when I\\'m not wearing my glasses and it\\'s never had an effect on me in the ring. Precision isn\\'t as important as it seems unless you\\'re doing something like springboards. I don\\'t get why they wouldn\\'t sign him over impairment like that despite him already proving he could work. Like you can probably just stay home for a year. What are Blake and Murphy doing anyways?  They seemed to be rising quite fast and then disappeared. Agreed. I liked that Owens held the belt, but his booking wasn\\'t all that great. Makes sense why people weren\\'t a fan of his reign. Total face. Just fought Konnor from The Ascension tonight after they tagged with Rowan in a 6-man match. You\\'d better not ever judge a fucking movie, TV show, or album then. You\\'re not a famous actor or recording artist so your opinion doesn\\'t mean shit. It bums me out that he only has the half the brain of this Yakimori guy. At least bobby was elevated to a big stage and used to put over a younger talent in McIntire. You can\\'t even compare this to TNA elevating ex WWE guys passed their prime  Did he get seriously injured? Looks like he could\\'ve seriously fucked up his neck the way he hit the turnbuckle and apron. Damn! Damn, he looks terrible First book was incredible, second was great as well. Third was much different, but still enjoyable. Got the new one on release date and haven\\'t had time to open it up yet. Cuz not everyone can make it to a show butthead \"From Hollywood, ~~Florida~~ California\"  This promo has Lesner saying my most favorite line: You havent faced anyone like me, because There is no 1 like me.\\n\\nThis line shoud be on the banner of our sub-reddit. Are we doing phrasing?  We bury young talent so deep the man w/ 3 H\\'s in his name would be proud! Orton vs Mahal at MITB and sd was good.\\n\\nNot great but good. Only bummer was it was literally a 10 second match  Little did anyone realize then, but Blake and Murphy would both be the Janetty of their Tag Team and their valet would be the Michaels.  &gt;Or maybe people could just be less shitty. \\n\\nLook around.  What world are you living in?  People are shitty.  And a famous person saying \"but please don\\'t\" isn\\'t going to stop it, or it would have stopped a long time ago.  Fame comes with unwanted attention. That\\'s not an opinion.  \\n\\nBeing famous means your life, in many ways, will be much more comfortable.  But, it doesn\\'t mean you are guaranteed NO discomfort.  \\n\\nUltimately, I just think it\\'s wiser for someone in Sasha\\'s position to focus on gratitude whenever she\\'s dealing with an aspect of her very successful life that she is uncomfortable with.  Because, as long as fame exists, fans who treat the famous poorly are going to exist.   \\n\\nAlso important to note - you\\'re equating fame and success in your comment.  There are many ways to pursue success without desiring or pursuing fame.  There are ways to be famous without being successful too.  Sasha wants success AND fame.  She should be real about what comes with those pursuits.      The god of the smarks actually looks like a god  I watch gfw but not wwe anymore so I can\\'t make a fair comparison, but im really loving gfw so im glad to have some wrestling i can watch in the USA. Australia, it helps that our coach is a former doctor, and his daughter who is our physician is very dedicated to the team and cares a great deal about all of us. Dying doesn\\'t put food on the table because you\\'re DEAD. You know how often wrestlers outside of WWE can actually afford life insurance, due to the high rates asked for because of their profession? Not very often. You don\\'t get to see your kids grow up, you\\'d be in constant pain every day prior to your death (which could adversely affect how you interact with your family and how they remember you), and not to mention the lack of glory your legacy holds if you die while in the indies, never making a name for yourself.\\n\\nI believe wrestlers have strong resolve and do this because they love this, but \"dying doesn\\'t put food on the table\" is a ridiculous statement. If a fucking doctor tells you if you keep wrestling, you\\'ll die, you should stop wrestling - for your family, and to be able to have an opportunity to provide for them through other means. (Even if there are few \"other means\" - there\\'s always means that don\\'t involve your death, and if you give half a damn about them, you\\'ll find them.) I get that people like celebrities and it can be cool to meet them, but having some fucking consideration. They\\'re people just like you and me. \\n\\n\\nImagine you just did something physically exhausting and then caught a red-eye flight right afterwards. You\\'re probably too hopped up on adrenaline still to sleep well on the flight. Then once you land you\\'ve got vultures stalking you in an airport to sign stuff that they don\\'t even truly want. They just want to turn a profit off of it.\\n\\n\\nFuck that. I\\'d be a bit of an ass too. They\\'re not estranged at all. She posted a screen cap of them talking on FaceTime a while ago.  I think it\\'s pretty obvious Zayn isn\\'t going to ever get to the top. \\n\\nCrowd would need to get behind him like Bryan and it isn\\'t gonna happen.  So am I allowed to be a Hulkamaniac or what. I have no idea what guy out of the 3 he is and nobody there did either. TIL Monday and Tuesday are the Weekend. Friday is basically the weekend. And at that point Wed/Thursday are close enough too. I\\'ll tell my boss that Monday(look how hard a worker I am going in on the weekend) and have him keep sending paychecks.  That last paragraph reminds me of this part of Punk\\'s Las Vegas promo:\\n\\n\"Let me get something straight, those of you who are cheering me right now… you are just as big a part of me leaving as anything else. Because you’re the ones sipping out of those collector cups right now. You’re the ones that buy those programs that my face isn’t on the cover of, and then at five in the morning at the airport, you try to shove it in my face thinking you can get an autograph and sell it on eBay because you’re too lazy to get a real job.\"\\n\\nI know, dumb comparison. Eh. That makes a different. Grassroots here is pretty informal, been at tons of matches where there is not team medic or anything like that.  Forgive my ignorance but are all Kmarts closing? They\\'ve been gone from my area well over a decade.  Unless he feels like dieing like Masa probably not. Also Masa was entertaining so he would add nothing. I can think of 2....The Sandman in ECW, and Bryan Danielson in ROH. And one of them would eventually go on to work for WWE as a creative writer, I suppose in some ways validating his nonchalant response to being murdered at a wrestling show /s Batista was only number 1 in 2005. Cena was number one in 2006 onwards  The nxt tag division is hot right now as well they really could have been acting as #1 contender gate keepers Which matches were good, which matches were bad \\n\\n\\nHow much time did Styles and nakamura get to wrestle each other Was this the finish? Or did it lead to the finish? sweeeeet this is a good idea, never give up on the gravy!  The cost of professional OTT service is somewhat preventative and as expectations of quality rise, some smaller/less profitable promotions will find themselves unable to compete with their current OTT-service vendors.  Now, what some of the more stable promotions COULD do is partner to contract services with OTT vendors allowing for a higher standard of quality for a less cost-preventative situation that would bar a single promotion from having such a service.  It would also allow a higher level of cross promotion/draw to the partnered OTT service as it would allow for subscribers from multiple fan-bases.   Me too. I keep telling myself that it\\'s *really* not likely that he will, but god do I want him to lol It\\'s not like it\\'s 100% unlikely, though. I mean, they didn\\'t even have to let him win that Battle Royal. They could\\'ve easily given that win to Jason Jordan, like everyone was expecting, but they didn\\'t. For some reason they went with Jeff, of all people. It blew me away when he won because I had written off the possibility as soon as the match started. Maybe that\\'ll happen again on Monday. You know, people tell me I\\'m crazy for not liking the who and I could never really explain why. Daltrey is awesome and entwistle is low-key one of the best bassists that ever walked planet earth and, I mean, Keith Moon... But it really boils down to Townshend being an obvious top shelf cunt I think. And the child pornography stuff is a really poor look as well.  I never get on hero for bein fat but man he used to have a real good look.  As for the people criticising him....a lot of wrestling fans are fat.  In KENTA\\'s case his real full name is Kenta Kobayashi, which is uncannily similar to his mentor Kenta Kobashi. So Kobayashi only used his first name and spelled it in English to differentiate between the two.  Really hope we get her in WWE soon. Saw her at an ICW show in Sheffield and it was amazing (even fought in the bar area).  Me too. All the Janet Evanovich stuff. But they should get on the treadmill next to him instead of talking shit Howd he fuck the Shiek over? Oh I mean people named lefty I fucking need shirts like these. Alexa owes her success to that team. They really helped elevate her to the character she is today. Miss her diamond knuckles. Fuck. This kid is incredible.  I think he\\'s the small town gym teacher who has to teach social studies because they can\\'t get anyone else.  Takes some imagination tbh plus you have to maintain rosters, come up with storylines, and determine and keep track of championship reigns.\\n\\nFor example, my Universe mode is all-CAW with a main show and a women\\'s show. I keep track of 7 championships: World, Midcard, Tag Team, Cruiserweight, World Women\\'s, Women\\'s Tag Team, and Women\\'s Midcard titles. That means a storyline for each because each belt is defended at the end of the month on PPV. Plus, other storylines for everyone else you want to feature. It\\'s a bit of work, but it pays to see your card come to fruition.\\n\\nOne of the main obstacles is the game\\'s auto-booking, which sometimes goes completely against your plans. Can\\'t tell you how many times I tried to build someone up only for the CPU to completely bury them and push someone else instead.  Ok.  We\\'re cool then. When Jericho was talking about Roman, he was saying something to the effect of, \"takes two to tango, brother.\" He kinda seemed like he denied the existence of carrying. Now he\\'s saying it\\'s Neville\\'s job to make Enzo look like a good wrestler? Which is it, Jericho? IKR. Winner of the Andre The Giant Battle Royal has to team up with ...ugh...Zayn. As a Zayn stan I am very, very morose.\\n\\nHe\\'s rumored to be joining RAW. I worry this\\'ll make shit worse.\\n\\nKev wants a face turn so at this point I\\'d love for them to tag. He\\'s a meme  Daniel Bryan did that for me.  I never watched his indie stuff so I just heard he was really good, but I found him to be sort of boring at first.  He was a good wrestler but I just did not find him entertaining.  Overtime he somehow became one of my favorites and I can\\'t honestly pinpoint when all of that happened for me. Whoosh CHICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCOOOOOOOO You have an example? Just curious on what he offered Sheik. So he\\'s Maharaja Buu? Love the Miz, but Ryder Respect is real. I mean he did make up with Warrior. It was caught on tape. But agree with everything else you got on there.  What\\'s interesting to note is that China has over 1.5 billion people but none of the chinese competitors in MYC got this many views.\\n\\n No but they are like sears, they are flailing  Well, first Hogan would actually have to admit to having been an asshole in the past. Somehow I doubt that he sees what he did to get ahead and keep ahead in the industry as wrong.  &gt;**I martyred myself for you!!!** He\\'s done that for the entirety of his career. He tires his opponents out then tags in Cass to clean up. He can pull it off I take the little one to it and the other kids in her class, 7/8, year olds bully her as it\\'s not real. But at work I talk with people who where brought up on the mid 90s and earlier 00 who enjoy it, maybe not as much on the indie scene but can still speak about matches and angles etc and about current story lines. So basically kids know and adults still try and believe. filthy knob slayer    \\n\"Dirty\" Dick Slater He promised him a rematch for the WWF Title and would return the favour one day for him. \\n\\nNever did.  Well done! Sorry if this sounds dumb, but in PWG kayfabe, is Scurll not in BC? what is the spoiler here exactly Well-thought doesn\\'t mean what they said was good and a lot of booking is okay. Really stuff the fans would like. Every time someone posts this gif, my initial reaction is \"Why the hell didn\\'t they have a cameraman closer to the performers??\"\\n\\nSeriously. Does that footage exist?? Fan cams?? This bump could have been ROH\\'s Taker/Mankind HiaC. I used to work out to this promo as cringy as that may be. Same with the Daniel Bryan vs. John Cena promo from this show too. Just pumps me the fuck up. I want Meltzer to do a run-in during a Young Bucks match, and then shit on the run-in during WON Live the next day. I honestly think he should leave, Lucha could make him a killer. (And that could actually happen well kinda)\\n\\nUnless he\\'s being paid well I suppose. It was making up with Randy Savage he was probably lying about. But somehow be resurrected by a certain major corporation. round this parts, I rather say I\\'m a chronic masturbator than admit I like pretend shoot fight  Yeah R.I.P. Eddie Guerrero can\\'t say it enough. All around great from in ring ability to promos. He had great matches in WCW and ECW but like the title says Ruthless Aggression was about making a name for yourself and if anyone did that it was him.   Which is what wrestling has been since the dawn of time. Ric Flair made a career of making shit wrestlers look a million times better than they actually are WHILE being the worlds heavyweight champion Wh.... why not use the turnbuckle? It was you all along? Oh my god! Someone left Braun in the dryer! Hogan lies to everybody about everything.  very valid points however Okada\\'s reign in NJ has proven it can be done well if done right. Omega didnt have his momentum killed, Suzuki didnt. Almost every challenger came out of their matches as a bigger star. Year long reigns are also a lot more palatable when there is another world title on the other side, having the WWE title change hands every few months should satiate fans appetites for a title change. On his part time schedule, Cena still has a good 5 years left at least. Plenty of time to break records and put people over.  Or trim the fucking thing. Way too long. New definition of the word \"spinner\". That\\'s fucking lame, but at least they are making something out of it.   thanks. The heads of the NFL are like the heads of a mafia family.  Yeah it\\'s called wwe, for entertainment. No one in wwe can beat Brock lesnar, using your logic, all lesnar\\'s past matches don\\'t make sense. Sorry I got you blocked big dawg They\\'re trolling at this point  Man, I don\\'t see why you can\\'t like them both. No, and they would kill Alexa\\'s act.\\n\\nPlus we like to pretend Alexa\\'s single and that we all have a shot. I wouldnt describe any of their presences on the show as chaotic- maybe ineffective. Didnt Goldust basically announce \"Im gonna be in an angle at SummerSlam\" and then wasnt  being fat is a gimmick  not necessarily added, more or so replaced, no need for an annual IC/Tag ladder match with the MITB there already. \\n\\nand stipulation wise getting rid of HIAC, Elimination Chamber, and TLC wouldn’t be too bad as Ladder and Table matches would still be around, we’d have steel cages still and tons of other stipulations we could use, i think it’d get along fine. nothing could be worse than 1995 Taka vs Taichi was a masterclass, not even Flair and Steamboat had a wrestling clinic like those too did Troll level: too good to be quantified  Braun wrestled 96-97? Because that shit happened for a month very recently. New Dale? New Day?  it\\'s like a Klon Same thing with my dad. Everyone always told me he looked amazing for his age and there was no way I was his son. Some health problems and a few hospital stays later and he\\'s aged quite a bit.  WEE-L-C 2, LETS GO! She\\'s so beautiful  It\\'s something like \"Oh, and you guys cheering me right now? You\\'re as big a part of me leaving as anything else. You\\'re the ones that buy those programs my face isn\\'t on, you shove those collector\\'s cups in my face at 3 in the morning at the airport to get me to sign them, then you sell them on eBay because you\\'re too lazy to get a real job!\" Baron Corbin inquired about the location of Maroon\\'s Will. Vince put the hit on Corbin. Vince wants Toon Town. It\\'s okay. You\\'re the real big dawg now. I\\'m afraid not There are many reasons to be jealous of Dean Ambrose.\\n\\nHe\\'s super successful. He\\'s in pretty good shape. he\\'s pretty famous.\\n\\nBut the reason I\\'m most jealous of Ambrose? he\\'s dating Renee. I always took it as \"wow one guy he wont autograph something \" then i saw the guys who took bags and made them sign 100 things. Now i see it as \"This guy is literally here waiting at 5 in the morning to get this to sell it\" I wish they would give those two like 35 minutes, because I would not be surprised if some people came around on the idea that Neville is even better than AJ.  Not saying I feel that way, but I truly think he is just absolutely on that level and it could be the best match WWE put on in a long time. What irks me the most is he\\'s clearly stronger than every other cruiserweight and they clearly don\\'t plan on having him leave the division, SO WHY THE FUCK DID THEY HAVE HIM DROP THE BELT TO TOZAWA I\\'m all in on anything that shines a bad light on Hogan.  Funny how him and Shawn were the biggest assholes in the biz, yet the most heavily christian as well.  What a world. You\\'re pretty spot on with that assessment. Except that I only have one eye, the other is prosthetic. 16 year olds who walked this planet lived without an active WCW in their lives. It\\'s entirely possible they simply didn\\'t know who they were. I watched WCW but didn\\'t recognize them. CM Punk was on fire during this period.  Here\\'s the thing - if Enzo won by some kind of bizarre fluke - roll up, ref out of position, etc - that might make a really fun angle with Neville just absolutely losing his fucking mind.  Obviously I\\'d prefer Neville to reign indefinitely and I wouldn\\'t want Enzo to ever actually win clean....but if they\\'re going to try and get casuals to watch 205 Live that may not be the worst way in the world to do it. She\\'s not wrong youweird Wow that\\'s a good one. But it\\'s not the answer we\\'re looking for If you\\'re short it sucks and also it sucks mostly when people stand up and don\\'t sit.  he\\'d have to cut off a leg to get down to 205 lbs. HOW it seemed so correct Well Sears owns Kmart so that would explain it. Noone show Kojima this. One is from the biggest news story in wrestling of all time.\\nThe other was part of the two biggest eras in wrestling.\\n How many of his matches did you watch? The 9 he had in NXT? Never feed the trolls. Well, where does the condom or the child come into it? You have this woman\\'s opinion as well. 🖒 I joined back in 2014 so I could get help in the WrestleMania travel thread, which is great. I used it again for Orlando this year.\\n \\nOther than that it\\'s just a waste of time. So many idiots on there. She\\'s absolutely right and it\\'s awesome she admitted it. She is not a good announcer. Ayyyyy. I didn\\'t know we or Sasha was teaching a class here.  This isn\\'t really a discussion about \"teaching younger generations\" you can do that in your life, and I hope you enstill values in the young people you interact with.  \\n\\nBreak down what it means to be famous.  The more famous you are - the more recognizeable you become.  The more famous you are, the more desired you are.  The more famous you become, those numbers grow.  \\n\\nAnd if you allow yourself to honestly look at the Human race, it\\'s reasonable to assess and accept that no matter our trying or teaching, there will be some that fall through the cracks, that either don\\'t understand, don\\'t know any better, or don\\'t care.  However they get there, they\\'re not going to behave respectfully around a famous person.  It\\'s just a product of what fame is and how people behave.  \\n\\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s a bad lesson or a bad idea to say that you shouldn\\'t meet famous people at the airport or their hotel.  It definitely, 100% is.  But it\\'s also totally unrealistic to expect anything else.  And, to use your platform to complain about something that won\\'t change, and make a direct comment on the fame that has made her life so much more interesting is a bad look and not a great attitude.  None of us are entitled to 100% comfort.  And most of us won\\'t touch the level of comfort Sasha\\'s life affords her.  It\\'s just a bad look imo.    #####E I\\'m 5\\'2 but the security made sure nobody stood.  Christian became the inaugural WHC by beating John Cena, Chris Jericho, and Roman Reigns in a Fatal-Fourway match. Months later, at Summerslam, he was dethroned by challenger Roman Reigns in about 3 minutes. (I dubbed it the \"Roman Shock\") \\n\\nHe proceeded to have the \"worst time of his life\" (Lost every \"big match\" and got injured). This culminated in him winning the Royal Rumble (barely) and defeating Roman Reigns at Wrestlemania to regain his spot on top. The Jamaican fella wanted me to color an action figure the same color as The Boss\\' wife Do you have a white mane of pubes? this makes me really hope WWE just signs him as a full time commentator some day. I mean he\\'s a pretty good heel if \"we\" want him fired right? Kind of doing his job? They ended a 7 month reign just to start another one 6 days later. Why? Cause Vince said the division needs something big to happen. Wtf I think the core of this problem is that people think someone having ANY opinion is somehow invalid.  This is all about a bunch of grown ass men pretending to slap each other in their underwear.  Things that you can be \"objective\" about are pretty limited.  The entire point of art and entertainment is that it is subjective.  Some people are never gonna love Roman Reigns.  some people are never gonna hate Roman Reigns.  But they just wanna have fun, Maggle. In terms of match quality I\\'d put it above Cena-Punk. Yeh it\\'s really weird that they would forget to put a wrestler underneath the title. He had a squash match against Strowman that was very noticeable. Backstage interview and an entrance. I\\'m saying recovered as a joke, but he\\'s def great. Future WWE material no doubt.\\n\\nHow\\'s DEFY? I know John Henigan defending his PCW title there coming up so I\\'m interested. The caveman stubbed his toe on the \\'N\\' shaped rock How much is that worth tho. Many guys are getting lean at the cost to themselves. He is paid to use his body. The dude has no excuse why he should look like this. Worse is his body is not bray or Owens type, he looks like he is not fighting to be the best he can be. Cheat, use drugs or get surgery. There are many options and he ain\\'t taking them. I\\'ll give you 2 British Dollar Sterlings for it. Sounds a lot like how Samoa Joe debuted, no?  If they have Enzo and Neville on this show it just shows how putrid the booking is in this company. The idea that Enzo will have earned a title shot in three weeks in the division is absurd, buries the belt, waters down Neville\\'s position and push in doing so, and when they inevitably have the shittiest worker in the company beat one of it\\'s three or four best, it buries Neville completely. What an awful idea. Enzo should have to pass through at least one cursory but real fued with either a PPV match or a kickoff show match, before being anywhere near the title picture. In reality, he should have to spend 9-12 months building towards and earning (kayfabe) the shot. Sadly, WWE doesn\\'t do long term booking, which is why the companies product is the worst thing in pro wrestling/sports entertainment not named GFW. He said he works out during commercials on RAW. No wonder he\\'s so fucking jacked.  WWKD I like JBL. Honestly he\\'s a great heel in ring and announcing. People aren\\'t supposed to like it. Even as someone who likes his gimmick his singles entrance smiling in that damn limo still pisses me off. Perfect heel  Ufc still does it I think Dakota Kai has her back. I thought it was Nakamura. Funny. A wrestling rivalry based on two former partners wanting to fuck is an anime that\\'s bound to happen some day  Well, to your point, most wrestling fans know who Kelly Kelly is, whereas I\\'ve never heard of Satomura in my life. In the wrestling business, that counts for something. Long Island Iced Z-pack!  I wonder if these type of fans look at Frank the Clown and go, \"he\\'s dating Noelle! I have a chance!\"  the condom is merely a vessel Any sources on that as I\\'ve never seen that reported anywhere? Nor ever seen any pictures, video, etc of her ever with a cigarette.\\n\\nAnd considering Vince and Triple H\\'s stance on it I would find that very surprising. He\\'s so cool. He\\'s got the look and can move around like Kane could at his best, he\\'s one of the only guys in WWE today that does a Suicide Dive that actually impresses me. I don\\'t even need him to win a title, I just want him on my TV screen. The window is closing rapidly on the Broken gimmick. If it doesn\\'t come back by, say, Survivor Series it will be too late. There is money to be made. I guess this is another instance of Vince being a millionaire who should be a billionaire. keep going. im just blocking any right wing nazi\\'s who want to come and defend this racist. i know you all group in pairs to attack people and bully them. Dont you have a transgender person to attack? GTFO fascists  I would be fine with Neville completely destroying Enzo like Brock did to Cena in 2014 Well,who isn\\'t? Even Cornette is interested in Omega in a BDSM sort of way.  It\\'s just a bunch of immature dumbasses who want attention. \\nThe people I dealt with, and have met, in the Mania travel thread are great though. Many helped with tickets, rides and accommodation.  The Undertaker. His music made the audience go apeshit and actively engage with the product.  But is Roman gonna cry though? Cause that\\'s one of the defining images for me in that Okada-Tanahashi feud.  Mexico is lucha country, baby.\\n\\n(being really into wrestling is still seen as weird, tho. it\\'s a big part of the culture but it\\'s not usual to follow it as many do with fútbol, for example)  The thing with the attitude era is... The athletism and in ring quality isnt as good as it is today, but the storylines were so great and way better then they are today and they made you care about what was going on in the ring. From low card to mid card to main event, everyone was entertaining Looking back almost all of Lacey\\'s RoH run was one long story about how she was this over high strung and controlling bitch. She debuted with and split Special K. She ditched them and traded up to Jacobs and Whitmer which lead to the Jimmy Loves Lacey feud and then Jimmy feuding with Cabana. Then that lead right into the Age of the Fall.  Big E to 205 Live confirmed. She was alright but she\\'s far more valuable in the role she\\'s in \\'99-\\'00 was nuts.  \\n  \\nCan I ask, and no, this is not preparing for a generational spat... were you alive/conscious of what life was like in the \\'90s?  Though I don\\'t think it\\'s been lost on you, some folks have a hard time understanding the novelty of WWE during that era due to a lack of temporal context.  Also, since you\\'re not also watching WCW/ECW at the time(which would be a huge task), there might be a bit of a difference in perception, in that case, as well(though, of course, not EVERYONE was watching all three, back then).  \\n  \\nI\\'m just curious because I\\'ve always found the take of people watching retroactively to be interesting.   Jericho is arguing that to be a truly elite tier wrestler in management\\'s eyes is to be able to craft a good match out of anyone. \\n\\nI remember coming back to watching WWE after a while around the end of Daniel Bryan\\'s in-ring career and watching him against the Big Show I\\'m Raw I was impressed that it seemed to me he was almost getting a 3-star math out of the Big Show when warily was show having a match over a star (general ratings).  It meant something about Bryan. To be honest the Big Show was not as bad of a worker as I was believing him to be so that also is a factor and he probably liked wrestling Bryan, but you had to give most of the credit to Bryan. Exactly..I have the same problem with Netflix as well... The Op gif is on purpose. The second one posted was a legit botch Anyway how\\'s your sex life? i grew up watching the ae era so im glad you enjoyed it. wwe\\'s current roster is probably the best theyve ever had as far as sheer talent goes,tho like you said with guys like angle, benoit (should be coming up), jericho, stone cold, the rock, they are just so good they cant more than carry the bad Option C, baby.  While it wasn\\'t all gold, it does seem like everyone had something to do... even IF it was ridiculous.   From the sounds of it, he\\'s just enjoying time off from wrestling. He also said he knows he\\'s getting up there in age and has to choose what is best for his body, I think he\\'ll be back there eventually considering his fiancé is in developmental.  Unfortunately most of the time \"the wrestling kids\" are the odd ones. Most of us wrestling fans are the excluded and unsocial ones growing up. They don\\'t grasp the social rules that most of us abide by. I can Def see both sides. And good on her acknowledging it and bringing attention to it that it\\'s not cool.  \"If you don\\'t like it, learn to love it.\"\\n-Ric Flair on Pro Wrestling He\\'ll do 1 super spear, where he runs back and forth between the ropes a few times. Beat HHH and Taker with it One of the most bad-ass wrestlers alive.\\n\\nSuzuki can hold his own, as well. While I agree with everyone in this thread saying she wasn\\'t the best.... is she really gonna be worse than JBl? That\\'s fair. I don\\'t understand why an adult fan with no kids would wait outside the wrestlers hotel. Do you not have anything better to do with your time? As far as the airport thing goes, to me it would be fine if it was completely coincidental that the person is there, though, you should always be respectful to the wrestler. If they don\\'t want to be bugged, don\\'t bug them. Can\\'t believe it\\'s already been a year since I posted my first Evolution video and here\\'s another one featuring The King of the Cruiserweights, Neville.

A sublime piece of art that shall never be touched. JBL had his moments. Otunga was far worse  AND MY AXE. Old TNA stuff alone is pretty rad Went from being one of the new generation of flippy-kids to being the(arguably) best ring-worker in the WWE.  Man has a right to be proud.   I\\'ve gotten through post Mania 14 to Foley winning the title and tapped out and haven\\'t watched anything else besides WM 17. There\\'s a lot of shitty storylines from that section I watched, and some good stuff but the bad is just more dominant than good to me.  Of course, who could forget such classic storylines as Hawk alcoholic, PMS and Meat, Chaz the woman beater, the Undertaker/Kane dissension and teaming that made no sense, The Goldust/Val Venis/Terri Runnels love triangle/fake pregnancy and The Rock and Billy Gunn\\'s feud. Personally, I\\'d take the worst of this year over any of those. I so want Neville to answer an AJ open challenge Yeah, I definitely think if they go about it the right way, it could work. I think I\\'m just worried because they haven\\'t been booking well recently (in general, although certain things have been well done), and I don\\'t trust them to pull this off. : \\\\ I think the best thing about this is if GFW does get AAA/Crash/NOAH stuff on their as well, it\\'ll hopefully FINALLY kick WWE in their ass to getting Progress/ICW stuff on the WWE network up and running.  Smarks maybe subscribe for old TNA along with shows from some of the companies GFW is working with, and they wind up fans of the current product? Sounds good.  This is not a popularity contest  Woooow That\\'s a ridiculous argument. All the lovely people here aren\\'t in a professional where the look of their body is important. Try harder. So Ric Flair just cut a promo on death. Right? Like, this counts? Golden☆Lovers will collide at WK12 [From the looks of it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYjTWOkF0sW/) she\\'s found a new posse. They would cheer the other 2 while booing Reigns. He\\'s damaged goods, they will boo this man forever. Every single show has delivered in a big way. The company itself has had some problems with last-minute wrestler cancellations, and the fact that the September 10th show was just cancelled a few days ago due to scheduling conflicts so the whole card was moved to the 29th, but the actual shows have all been great. How is it dumb? In no way is he saying he supports it. He\\'s right. The paparazzi and fans stalk famous people a lot. It\\'s nothing new. It\\'s not OK but try to keep your cool and move along. Maybe you make someones day. Sure he\\'s probably a creep but at least you\\'re doing something cool.  I can understand why people don\\'t like enzo, He\\'s not a good wrestler and his Off-screen personality is his character turned up to eleven ( I kinda like that about him, but i digress). What i don\\'t understand is when some people say that he should get bullied and assaulted until he \"acts right\". That i have a problem with. Six They come across as.... Humans. It\\'s what they are! \\n\\n\\nThey come across as being humble. Respectable.  Wait...you\\'re getting downvoted, so is that not how it happened? Because I always heard he was fired. Damn, the Hardy\\'s are great at promos. Also made me realize how bad everyone in the modern day is at promos I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t go with \"come together at WK12\" And yet your entire argument is that he cant be as great creatively add peyote claim because his business failed. \\n\\nPick an argument and stick with it. And please tell me more able how losing the likes of Austin, Foley, Jericho,  Benoit, Guererro, The Dudleyz, Raven,  Lance Storm, Malenko, Mysterio, and others can just be overcome by good creativity.  Lol Cena\\'s jaw after clotheslining KO in that replay Yeah that\\'s a good way to sum it up. The comment sections on wrestling videos on YouTube are bad too! Yes. There are none How do \"fans\" not understand this? \\n\\nA few months ago, a set photographer who\\'s worked on a lot of my favorite films from recent years visited the city I live  and posted about it on Twitter, etc. I live in the Middle East and this was probably my only chance to meet someone connected to something I\\'m a die hard fan of, but weighing it against the fact that I\\'d pretty much have to turn into a stalker to do so, I decided against it. \\n\\nI\\'m not trying to paint what I did as some selfless sacrifice; instead, what I did is what should be the commonly agreed upon behavior. \\n\\nDON\\'T FUCKING FEEL SO ENTITLED AS A FAN THAT YOU INTRUDE UPON PEOPLE\\'S PRIVACY AND SENSE OF SPACE, SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND. Then again, in a culture where celebrities are seen as the bad guys for lashing out at intrusive paparazzi, it\\'s no wonder this facet of basic courtesy goes over the heads of so many. Is there somewhere I can buy than Pancrase shirt? Or is it just that old? The problem isn\\'t in people changing their opinions, its in acting like they never believed anything different. I rarely see people be like \"Man I used to hate X, now I like him though.\" Instead the tone suddenly shifts and it becomes \"Man X is awesome, I love him!\" out of nowhere.\\n\\nWorst of all are the karma farmers, who note the shift in tone, and then pick their opportunity to post \"Everyone hates X, but you shouldn\\'t and here\\'s why\", or \"Am I the only one who thinks X has improved?\"\\n\\nThese people know the general opinion has shifted, but they pretend like it hasn\\'t, so everyone else looks at it and goes \"Hey! I think that too!\"\\n\\nFor people who don\\'t visit regularly, all they see s a sudden polar shift of opinions and more often than not, a re-writing of history as to the previous opinions on this person.\\n\\nOpinions are not nuanced, they are not grounded in the full spectrum of someone\\'s character and history. They are knee-jerk reactions to the current trend as to what, and who, is popular.\\n\\nThat is what people mean they suddenly say \"Why does everyone love X now?\" Did you watch this on the network? I\\'m interested in doing this but their search is weird. And my axe! https://youtu.be/qmKUxZ38ouQ I just found out that line comes from this song.\\n\\n[Dave Dudley-Truck Drivin\\' Son of a Gun](https://youtu.be/6iVDLY7t-uc?t=54s) &gt;[**Referee &amp; WWE Wrestler Triple H Brutally Attack A Fan Who Sneaks Up On Stone Cold!

That hair. Been a fan since the Dirt Sheet.  Anyone who likes Miz and hasnt seen those should go find the whole series.\\n\\nMr. Fuji! &gt; Hopefully one day we could live to see another time like it.\\n  \\nI don\\'t think we will... specifically because of the communication conditions you mentioned.  When you watched on Monday night... you thought about it the whole week and anticipated... you had to wait for the mags to let out details of behind the scenes stuff... you actually talked face-to-face with friends instead of random strangers who you give no chance to elaborate on the internet... anticipation builds... you watched on MONDAY... and if you were really dedicated, Saturday or Sunday depending on the syndication in your area(but you knew those were lower card performers).  \\n    \\nPerformers from other promotions debuting were surprises most of the time... if an indy guy you\\'d heard of or knew of showed up... it resonated differently... because you might just have an IDEA of what to expect, instead of just being disappointed \"they were better in blah blah blah\"...  \\n    \\nWhile the product might not have been fundamentally better... the perception of the product and its framing was entirely different... \\n  \\nI think that only promotions like PWG who are scarce in their marketing/distribution are able to maintain that in this day and age.   I hate that he gets so much shit for this when he was just the messenger being fed the lines for his job. I\\'ve always love Schiavone and now listening to WHW, some stuff he talks about makes sense. Has the world gotten so idiotic that I can\\'t even tell if this person is a troll or not anymore? Yeah having no charisma generally won\\'t get you much screen time or storylines. Well when you\\'re in a company filled to the brim with really good wrestlers you need something more than that. Honestly, I think this is way too soon for them. Make a wrestling show people want to constantly tune into before trying to make an OTT streaming service. Even WWE should try to make their product better and not just expect the Network to \"just work\". I wish that both Ohno and Owens would lose some weight and get better gear. But I\\'m still a huge fan of both of them. What\\'s his medical disorder? Cody Rhodes Vs Michael Elgin\\n\\nCody Rhodes Vs Juice Robinson\\n\\nCody Rhodes vs Okada\\n Wrestling is very much a cosmetic industry.

I think they were a better team than NAO, and to think NAO not only won multiple tag titles, but held singles titles as a team while Enzo and Cass never won anything. Jinder did everything asked of him and made a fool of himself for years, he has paid every due and made scores of performers look good.   I feel like Elbow Indian wrestlers are draws in India.\\n\\nIn other news, water is wet. Triple H is not a profressional fighter It stays free on ddt universe forever. Just login and watch What\\'s crazy is I could see either guy doing that spot. I\\'d do that only if the rest of the division isn\\'t good, which isn\\'t true. There are so many amazing Cruiserweights on 205 Live that it\\'s ridiculous! I would absolutely love to see Neville go back into the title pictures of other belts, though I\\'d do it after he lost the Cruiserweight title and have him go even crazier, but also have that pay off by him starting to win outside the division. Did Minoru dodge the knee and roll out of it? Because why the hell else would he be falling in the *opposite* direction of the move\\'s momentum?  A happy version of Wyatt\\'s theme Their username checks out.  John Hennigan as Johnny Blaze. Your post:\\n\\nStatement 1: a valid point\\nStatement 2: completely shit on the point of statement 1 I can think of a lot of things that would\\'ve made that match become \"not the worst thing on the entire show\". Did he have a stroke? Just call it \"My Name is Hulk\" and I would probably be in. Such as? The feud feels dumb because of the way it\\'s happening. Nia has been a non-factor since her Raw debut, and Sasha should\\'ve kept the title for a few months at least. I would\\'ve had Nia feud with Emma for a little bit, and Alexa finally gets back the title in a gimmick match before doing this feud. Only thing I know is that he hasn\\'t set the world on fire since he was brought back. That\\'s right. I completely forgot about that. Conveniently fails to mention the brilliance that was Beaver Cleavage.  This subreddit is just like any slice of humanity. Good, bad, and everything in between. I like most series posts on here, this one peeked my interest as per usual.  Except I had a worry about embolding idiots to involve themselves in a match.  Just a thought. Cuss me out if I\\'m wrong (or at least be funny). Ruby and Kay Lee Ray. I was laughing at the video packages too because it was usually just those two getting beaten up. You\\'d be losing money not to buy it. Agreed. But it\\'s a shame how much that role has been diminished. Other than pre-post PPV stuff, she\\'s back to where she started in the company. If there\\'s nothing else in store for her, I\\'d like to see her move on from WWE.  Like Punk is? I can walk into any Crossfit gym in America and find someone who could do as well as Punk did against Gall.  &gt;Brooklyn III blew me away \\n\\nBrooklyn III had me hooked until the end of the main event. Bobby Roode hits his DDT and McIntyre kicks out. No problem there. Roode eventually hits the DDT again and while he\\'s transitioning into a third, McIntyre immediately recovers, blocks it, headbutts him, hits Running Kick 3 and the match is over. Just felt very flat and anticlimactic. I don\\'t know. That finish did nothing for me.\\n\\nEdit: Predictably downvoted. Instead of doing that, explain to me how that finish WASN\\'T lame. I don\\'t buy for a second that this story is the reason Corbin lost his main event push Agree to disagree, I think that match is severely overrated from a match quality standpoint. Don\\'t get me wrong, the atmosphere and backstory was incredible, but it was kind of sloppy during the actual match. I think the Christian/Orton matches, especially their Summerslam match are all time classics. He\\'s a family man getting a solid paycheck and the ability to travel home weekly. He shouldn\\'t go anywhere and he won\\'t.  No. And the match would be 5*s. We don\\'t deserve Luke I dunno, if I was a celebrity I\\'d probably do it for a laugh.  Christian looks so dead on the inside. You\\'re conveniently calling people right-wing nazis so that you can \"justify\" whatever the fuck you\\'re doing here? And you have the gall to accuse  someone who has a different opinion than you, of being a \"racist\"? For one, you just can\\'t throw red herrings left and right like that...\\n\\nJust... Just stop making yourself look stupid and GTFO. This is still my favorite match of all time, such great story telling in that match. It was like reading a book. It wasn\\'t about Punk vs Brock, it was about Punk vs Heyman. Punk just had to get through Brock to get to Paul. In the match you see it a few times, Brock is whooping his ass but then Punk sees Heyman and and keeps clawing back. Brock wasn\\'t used to that, and Punk just kept pulling shit out of no where but he couldn\\'t capitalize on it because he was so wrapped up in getting his hands on Heyman. So much so his one equalizer ended up being his downfall. Just when he had Brock where we wanted he got distracted with Paul and lost because of it. \\n\\nI\\'ve probably watched that match 100 times and it\\'s never gotten old.  &gt; One man\\'s opinion anyways.\\n\\nBruh every hardcore wrestling fan thinks this. Those 2 are fucking fantastic. Wish Neville was on the \"main roster\" still so he and AJ could potentially have the match of the year as far as WWE is concerned.  I don\\'t mind Graves calling both Raw and SmackDown. Only the wrestlers should be subject to the brand split.  Apart from Nia it\\'d be plain unrealistic for them to bump around like buffoons for anyone else on Raw , it\\'d be like a Singh Brother beating 2 Randy Ortons. Yeah, exactly.  It\\'s pretty fucking reprehensible behaviour.\\n\\nRic Flair shouldn\\'t have to PAY for fucking drugs, what is this world coming to? [Good decision! Use this!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsZCBTpKjHzdbCpKZ1No1KAdpmOd2OcgSMfC1-oa7pI/edit#gid=0)\\n\\nThere\\'s English navigation available, it\\'s just Google Translated and very very easy to find. Dave is definitely on some Roids.  &gt; tossed Natalya\\n\\n ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Guy who likes Basketball Jerseys, and loves to Kick and elbow people in the head.  It\\'s a cesspit, it\\'s 10 times than what Squared Circle could ever be. Is this the Skinemax version of Steen/Generico, or nah? Holy shit he\\'s wearing his extra super duper effort pants. They\\'re going for all the stars tonight.  I think dieting and lifting would be a healthier alternative than surgery or drugs. But I get what you\\'re saying, I feel the same way about Owens. Or Renee Young Italy, wrestling is not socially accepted any more. From Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit deaths there was some kind of battallion against it. Wrestling was on TV, free TV, one of the most important channel at 8 pm, then it disappeared, only on satellite on Sky. Just recently he returned on free TV the digital, but sunday morning because it\\'s considered for kids. People talk about it just in wrestling forum or wrestling sites, there\\'s always a bit shame. They also built their global empire by destroying small, regional businesses across the country.  And since when do people outside of \"the business\", have to care about drawing power?  I respect that Miz is willing to do that, but wrestlers have a right to be like \"I\\'m too fucking tired for this rn and you stalkers are assholes.\" Yes. That side of the barrier, with a sizeable direct debit to ticketmaster. Bill Murray in Space Jam He\\'s also stylish af I jumped in at Wrestle Kingdom 9 (GFW provided English commentary which isn\\'t on NJPW World, but that is the point where you see more and more shows in English)\\n\\nIf you want to just get up-to-date on the current product immediately and quickly, you should get most of what you need from these shows. This is all in order + English commentary for all of them (helps to familiarise yourself)\\n\\nWrestle Kingdom 11 (amazing show, every match delivers)\\nSakura Genesis 2017 (lots of Wrestle Kingdom rematches)\\nG1 Climax 2017 - Night 1\\nG1 Climax 2017 - Night 2\\nG1 Climax 2017 - Night 17 (Naito vs Tanahashi 3)\\nG1 Climax 2017 - Night 18 (Omega vs Okada 3)\\nG1 Climax 2018 - Night 19 (G1 Finals)\\n\\n WILL YOU STOP?!?!  Hopefully this means that the Smackdown commentary will be a bit more bearable now. Though, they need to get rid of Byron. I would much rather have Bryan or Nigel on commentary. My hope is that they don\\'t try to shoehorn Booker into JBL\\'s spot after Otunga comes back to RAW. i know what i know through osmosis from wreddit: bullet club and LIJ are cool, omega vs okada are must watch matches, something about a junior division? other than that, i\\'m jumping in with no knowledge &gt; He was building a good following, then they completely pulled the rug out from under him. Sometimes it feels like they are purposely sabotaging their own product.\\n\\nYou don\\'t know if ANY of that is true.\\n\\nThere are a million reasons why he may not be as present on TV as some would like -- and not all of them are necessarily bad.\\n\\nMaybe his mom died and he had to take time off, and so they gave his spot away, because that\\'s just the nature of the business.\\n\\nOr maybe his wife just had a baby?\\n\\nPoint is, you don\\'t know that\\'s what happened, so it\\'s really telling that that\\'s the first place your mind goes.\\n I do understand why some people would like it even though I personally didn\\'t. By the way, I got a link that somebody on WF called me out and made a thread saying I was a Bliss Mark. And I\\'m like, dude I just used her as an example. I could have said the same thing about Sasha Banks, Bayley, and a bunch of others. The funny thing is he calls me that, when in fact I have a good amount of criticism for Bliss, especially when it comes to her booking. It just goes to show you how horrible some of the people are on that site. You say positive things about a person, even with some criticism added, you are called a mark. It\\'s like you can\\'t escape it. I might address me being called out tomorrow in a separate thread and be done with it after that. that\\'s what people fail to realize about the attitude era it wasn\\'t about great in ring matches it was about pure over the top zaney entertainment  Card subject to change Oh no they\\'re multiplying. From where are you watching???\\n\\nLU has a network?? Somebody tell me. It\\'s dumb because it\\'s basically saying that famous people shouldn\\'t complain about stalker losers because they\\'ll always be there. Instead of, idk, trying to combat that so they don\\'t have to deal with stalker losers. Maybe he can get some airtime in NXT? Me to man, every time this match comes up (including this time) I go on a similar rant explaining how awesome the story telling is. That spot where Brock has Punk set up for a fallaway slam, but Punk is facing Heyman and he is taunting Punk. The camera shows Punks face and he is enraged. That shit was just so good.  You do this?  This is great.  Well the problem is, that Wrestlers, no matter how fucking good they are, always get reduced on their looks by a bunch of people.\\n\\nWhy even bother watching Wrestling, when Bodybuilding exists? Pay attention to that, if you have such a huge problem overweight athletes.  I thought both Scots would go through due to the ICW friendship but then I forgot about WWE at times likes to go for the Latin American audience and the commentary about Sugehit\\'s CMLL history made me think she\\'ll win this one, was surprised cause I thought the ICW Friendship would slightly overweigh the Latin audience especially when there\\'s already Kalisto/Metalik. those are reasons to not be jealous of ambrose  But they were a small regional business when they started, running nearly all of their big shows from Manhattan. Like the President they managed to become a big fish in a big pond. That’s something he would likely admire. I certainly admire it as well.  It\\'s crazy that there\\'s an entire section of wrestlers that are amazing and some of the best in the world that just 6 months ago I was completely in aware of. I know there\\'s many possibilities of ulterior motives on WWEs end but I\\'m so happy the introduced me to the whole European scene.  He does, but he got punished when he went over by himself. You know when someone go over and they didn\\'t think about it most of the time they punish him. Yeah and by the way somebody on Wrestling Forum saw this post and called me out (as well as calling me a Bliss Mark, even though I only used her as an example and I could have used Bayley, Sasha Banks, and others). I\\'m going to make one last post tomorrow on the matter and be done with it for good.  Done by Mr Lariato on twitter. He tries to update it every so often.  thank you! i\\'ll check some of these out. *\"Then I told Ishii you chop harder...\"* It can. However it can also totally silence discussion around an act. Reddit (site wide, not just here) falls into a weird trap where there\\'s a portion of users who genuinely police opinion. They will downvote what they disagree with, and wade into anything in minus numbers insulting the poster looking for hero points. \\n\\nThe first half hour to an hour on any large sub, this included, dictates what is OK and what is not OK to say in a topic. If it\\'s about a controversial wrestler, then it\\'s a garbage fire. If it\\'s about a performer where there\\'s a clear broad consensus, it doesn\\'t say anything new because anything against the status quo is downvoted and belittled. \\n\\nThat\\'s why you get seeming \"sudden\" flips - it takes an event, either they say something racist, or they bully someone, or on the flip they have an incredible match and win a title, and \"suddenly\" opinion changes, because the majority are talking about it.\\n\\nDiversity of opinion is there, you have to hunt for it. I like to try and re-balance votes with an upvote if I can, if the person is being civil but expressing an unpopular opinion. Case in point - I got hammered for hating on Enzo around the time of his knockout with the Vaudevillains - I saw someone who was excitable and sloppy, the majority saw someone who was cool and funny but had some bad luck. There\\'s no \"right\" answer, but both are takes that could be discussed. Similar with Jinder. Is he bad? To some people, sure. Some people don\\'t see anything different in him than the bland botchy jobber he was a year ago. Others think he\\'s improved. There\\'s no real \"right\" answer, just opinions. I wish people would be more tolerant of different perspectives on reddit, but particularly on this sub. I would argue that they are the embodiment of unhealthy competition in the economy.  I\\'m sure Bray said it was gonna steal the show or good luck following it in an interview before Mania. I can only assume they didn\\'t know what was planned at that point.  Yeah, Tyler is a freakshow. What\\'s more is he\\'s only going to get better and better. \\n\\nI do hope when he ends up in WWE full time, he\\'s allowed a power move set. That\\'s what sells him, and that can exist in WWE in smaller performers - it would make him really stand out.

So anybody going to one soon is likely gonna see the same thing I miss the countdown and intro before the \"BREAK THE WALLS DOOOOOWWWN\" part.  Test &amp; Albert? I think he\\'s just going through the motions until they have him and Rowan return to TV as a team. It stinks given how they failed to capitalise on his momentum but there you go.  For a real book no, but it\\'s not cheap for an ebook.  Care to explain why you, as a fan, would rather watch a more popular wrestler over another who is a better wrestler? Yeah, Vince was actually a billionaire for the first time since the height of the Attitude era. Crazy how Bo Dallas was the future and they ruined him, he\\'s still pretty young though so things can still change, but him becoming world champion seems impossible at this point I don\\'t trust any adult males who still wear affliction shirts. Murphy was on the Australian NXT house show episode at the start of the year, but apart from that nope. Do you just look at all issues and say \"well, life isn\\'t fair, so sucks to suck\"? I still love the \"Day One\" promo I feel like WWE is using his lack of TV appearances as a means to get him more time to get in better ring shape so he can actually be repackaged. But who knows, it could just be \"we have other plans that trump your angle with Hideo\"\\n\\nFor his sake i hope its the former, not just for his future career, but for his health and well being too. I was thinking Fandango American Males\\n Brand split Bryan.  That\\'s.... goooood... right?  I just ran into Kurt Angle at a airport last week, and he was kind enough to take a picture with me. I just got off my flight and was walking to baggage claim when I ran into him. So hopefully he doesn\\'t think I was just lurking about or whatever. It\\'s why the Bros are on my short-list of folks I bring up when people ask the \"Who do you hope NEVER signs to WWE...\"  \\n  \\nIt would be a tragedy to water them down.   Dude has no reason not to be wwe champion in the next 5 years. The injury vs Jericho was the best thing to ever happen to him.  I believe that was vs. D.Bry at Summer Slam 13 Definitely not, Mr. Lariato I believe created it. They\\'re obviously a troll. Dirty Dave\\'s been hitting the weights  \"Hello Mr. Wrestler, I\\'m a grown ass man here to say hello and say I love your work. Yeah...well cool. Can I now get a picture and autograph? I\\'m just going to make some cool hand gestures now. No big deal. K. Thanks.\"\\n\\nEvery grown man who approaches another grown man in the airport for an autograph or picture should be ashamed of themselves. It\\'s quite sad to be honest. I enjoy wrestling but I don\\'t got shit to say to those people.  if WWE hosts a tag team tournament though.. i\\'d def want to see them in it Thanks Regal. No - I don\\'t, and you\\'re being very intellectually shallow in the way you\\'re assessing my comments. It\\'s insulting and frankly a little bit alarming that your value system is so threatened by matter of fact realism that you claim it\\'s \"defeatist\" and assume that I can\\'t be anything but a nihlistic hopeless depressive.  I take issue with that.  \\n\\nI think there are battles worth fighting and ones that aren\\'t and it is far greater folly to fight a losing battle because you feel obligated to \"hope\" for victory.    I think a famous person complaining publicly about the way they are treated by fans in almost every context is just as entitled, if not more so than the fans being criticized.  That is a losing battle and it\\'s not worth fighting.  \\n\\nAnd, I think it really is, in the interest of fairness, important to remember that Sasha\\'s fame and success have come with many many many benefits and comforts that none of her fans will never ever experience.  Fame is not perfect, even if it better than average.  I thought the same thing when Punk would bring it up.  \"Suck it up.\" is exactly what I think, and my suspicion is people like The Rock, Cena, Austin, Hogan etc who have reached the superstardom Sasha claims to dream of would say \"Suck it up\" too.  \\n\\n  That\\'s not what the word hypocrite means. It doesn\\'t apply to straight facts. Only 1 of the two confirmed matches will have shenanigans. Miz will 100% have shenanigans. Safe to say the same for Bliss. Bray match has a shot at some shenanigans as well.  If I can go back and watch old tna from like the mid 2000s I\\'m so down. I sincerely want Bobby Roode to go full TNA with the title. Get it and make it impossible to get it off him, adding his new Glorious shtick to it. Roode screams face of a brand IMO They\\'re like boobs for guys. Cool pic after the 6 man tag\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/Flaux/status/904237907413630977 You\\'re right about 1999 being weaker than 1998. It\\'s pretty lousy at it\\'s worst watching it back now, though it was never hard to watch at the time. I think you\\'ll enjoy 2000 though, based off of what you have said. So much of the roster was at their absolute best that year and the roster was stacked to the point that you had a lot of everything you wanted. Star power, match quality, comedy, hot women. (Edge and Christian are hilarious from April on, especially when they really find their groove second half of the year)\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s neat though that 1998, 1999 and 2000 all have a different feel to them. Like, so much changed year to year without the company really going through many changes as far as the roster goes (minus adding Jericho, Angle and the Radicalz). Yada yada no broken Matt  [**@Flaux**](https://twitter.com/Flaux/)\\n\\n&gt; [2017-09-03 07:01 UTC](https://twitter.com/Flaux/status/904237907413630977)\\n\\n&gt; ALL THESE GUYS \\\\#PWG \\\\#BOLA \\\\#BOLA2017 \\n\\n&gt;[[Attached pic]](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIx_gFdUMAAjigk.jpg) [[Imgur rehost]](https://i.imgur.com/Tup5SdV.jpg)\\n\\n----\\n\\n^This ^message ^was ^created ^by ^a ^bot\\n\\n[^[Contact ^creator]](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jasie3k&amp;amp;subject=TweetsInCommentsBot)[^[Source ^code]](https://github.com/janpetryk/reddit-bot)\\n Sparkle Splash Forever &lt;3 Sitting in a section you don\\'t have tickets for is a dick move.  She is now overrated. Nothing is in moderation these days... Bailey The dude\\'s body of work over the last couple years speaks for itself. From taking over AJ\\'s spot leading Bullet Club to G1 to Wrestle Kingdom to this years G1. Consistently on fire. He has a good look, charisma in what little promo time NJPW allows. He is the hottest NA talent not on the WWE\\'s dime.  &gt;WALTER got \\'please come back\\' chants\\n\\nAwesome. That guy better blow up by the end of the year. \\n\\nAlso LETS GO BROLA 2017. \\n\\nHow were the tag matches?  Bummed I couldn\\'t manage to find a ticket for tonight, but I\\'ll be there tomorrow for the finals! Illegitimate son storyline when? That shirt is amazing. I\\'m a sucker for things like this, so good on them It may take a day for it to be archived on the site so they can fix any video issues that occurred during the stream. But it will be there. You know, someone took these pictures. Which means that somewhere out there there\\'s another album of the guy taking these pictures also posing with wrestlers while Brock Lesnar Guy takes the pictures. I can\\'t imagine Dolph makes near that much money.  He hits cody rhodes with a moonsault off the steel cage at a indie show. I think we are missing the most important thing here \\n\\n\\n\\nWE CAN\\'T MAKE ADAM COLE IS DEAD JOKES ANYMORE What\\'s Tic Tac Toe Sheet doing in the Full Sail Arena?!?! Enzo &amp; Cass? /s It really all depends on the surroundings. Whenever I see a wrestler (or any celebrity I suppose) in public I just ask, if this person wasn\\'t a celebrity, would it be socially acceptable for me to speak to them?\\n\\nIn Dallas I saw JR drinking at the bar in the Ritz-Carlton, by himself. So I Went up and said hey. Figured if he was any other guy, small talk at the bar wouldn\\'t be inappropriate. Didn\\'t linger, didn\\'t bug him, just hey, I\\'m a fan, cool to run into you.\\n\\nThen I saw Lawler at the JFK memorial. He was with his family, so I didn\\'t bother him. If he wasn\\'t Lawler, it would be really fucking weird to go up and start talking to some random stranger at the JFK memorial. Saw a kid go up to him and ask for a picture, which I thought was OK - its different if its a kid, you know? \\n\\nI have never, ever understood why people hound these guys.  In a world where comedy jobber Jinder Mahal is WWE champion, why is comedy pseudo jobber Enzo Amore as Cruiserweight champion so strange? Glad no fights broke out. I\\'d be so pissed with someone in my seat. Pretty shitty they told the crowd to deal with it themselves. If that happened with WWE or NJPW people would be up in arms on here.  Didn\\'t help Ziggler much. It\\'s great to see a group of genuinely entertaining and funny guys having a great time making something that can be definitively theirs, with their own control and minds making it. Excellent. Personally I liked LDRS vs Ricochet and Sydal the most but they were both a ton of fun with all the high spots you\\'d expect. ZSJ and Scurll make a great team.  Haha, where was this? If it’s within striking distance of Bournemouth I’m absolutely making the trip.  I\\'m not watching your shitty propaganda. I WAITED HERE AT BAGGAGE CLAIM FOR 8 HOURS SO YOU WILL TAKE A FUCKING PICTURE WITH ME! against zayn at payback 2016 I was thinking it yesterday, but I\\'m gonna say it now: Matt Riddle is gonna win\\n\\n##BROLA2017      He used it against hawkins, Bray, Sheamus and others I respect that its what that they have to do to hire their talent, but having to wait a couple months to see what happens on the hottest event of the independent scene is bullshit.    WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Man, when I was kid my sister (of all people) would make fun of me for liking wrestling. She always called it gay, flash forward a decade later and here I am more excited about seeing this than almost anything within that decade. No to any Shield reunion. Roman has his own career path now. The only reason Seth and Dean are together is to get Seth over, he had a dead feud with HHH (not his fault), then a dead feud with Joe, then a dead feud with Bray. This story is about Seth, not about Roman and his two buddies, which is what it would become if they\\'re used to get him the Universal Title.  I can\\'t figure out what it is either. He looks goofy here, in the face even. Now he looks like a monster, and his face looks like some serious, hardcore shit. But he\\'s Lashley and this is like ten years apart. And it\\'s not like he\\'s using facial hair or anything. I\\'m a big fan of the Lance \"He Was Always Nice To MEEE\" Storm shoots... mostly because I find the others a bit too depressing.   I love Kenny King. Marty doing his best scoby-doo impression in the end killed me Lol they still keep getting worked after 6 years.  Dude get a grip in reality. WWE is a scripted show believe me if you went and cut your own promo and storyline yiu will be fired on the spot  Why\\'d he do that Dave gonna violate that wellness policy.\\nWould love to see him do a run in some day and hulkster style tear the shirt off. Imagine the pop. Well, he could call the NFL players union, heard they got heat with that maroon  Bland underwear model. As good as Triple H. Tbf it\\'s still pretty dangerous. And it\\'s much better than the normal version where the receiver does 99% of the work. This is more like a sunset flip piledriver. It\\'s been like this for 10 years, you get used to it haha. They\\'ve actually been really really good this year at getting the events out in the mail within 3 weeks too. Limiting myself to WWE only, I\\'d have the same first six, and finish:\\n\\n7. Jim Cornette\\n8. Randy Savage\\n9. Vince McMahon\\n10. Joey Styles\\n\\nStyles could maybe be higher if you included ECW. If you included WCW and his getting the nWo over, maybe Heenan and JR switch spots.\\n\\nAlways thought Macho was entertaining as a kid when he was in the booth. \\n\\nVince contributions as the straight man to Macho, Heenan, and then later with Jerry and JR can\\'t be denied. I grew up with him. He doesn\\'t make the cut though if you include Tenay, Schiavone, and Zybysko. Vince was sort of like a less offensive Michael Cole in the booth. \\n\\n I was referring more to the destruction of the territory system. super chill zen master Progress fans too, very respectful group of people. Yeah, and that promotion is probably called AAA. And when you state a fact on Reddit the little fanboys come out and downvote lmfao Of course that *would* have been ideal.  What connotes \"a big enough city?\" A city with a smarky crowd?\\n\\nYeah fuck that noise. They can do the steel chair thing, which is even better imo. He probably went over them, leaned through the middle rope and then went out.  https://imgur.com/a/Yom0m What he did didn\\'t prevent the NWA from having new territories. They were essentially franchises that he bought out. The NWA still exists, and would have remained relevant if they had found an investor with enough capital to make them competitive. They didn\\'t, and Billy Corgan arrived way too late to the party to make a difference. Who are the Lucha Bros (Penta y Fenix) teaming with? I work in a book store, so I have way too much time to think about stuff like this. \\n\\nHis look, his dirty grimy look suits him and his characteristics perfectly. He seems like he would stab you in the back in a back alley of a biker bar with a broken bottle over something stupid. He seems like he enjoys hurting people because he has a death wish himself and just wants to be around death and pain, but in like a cool way instead of an emo way. His body is obviously super cut and muscular, but it\\'s got a layer of meat on him to add a little cushion and add to that \"idgaf about anything\" vibe. Like yeah, I could look like a model, but I don\\'t really give a shit.\\n\\nRing wise, his move set is explosive enough that he can come from nowhere with a flurry of offense without it seeming like it\\'s just his turn. He has a crazy mix between technical wrestling and borderline lucha things that can lead to such original and creative spots. One of my favorite scenes from Omega Okada 3 was where Okada was trying to pump himself up and the camera zoomed in on his face and then all of a sudden omega\\'s legs are around his head for a reverse rana. \\n\\nOne thing all my favorites have in common is that they don\\'t just sell what their opponents do, they sell what they do, too. Bret\\'s sharpshooters were incredible because he sold that each one was a big deal. I can picture in my head as he struggled to turn someone over and they tried to wriggle out, or he knew it was over and started celebrating as soon as he wrapped the legs. Omega doesn\\'t just pretend to be hurt if someone hits him. He pretends he\\'s tired, he pretends it\\'s hard, he sells his moves so that we get invested in them. What he does in the ring matters. \\n\\nHe\\'s fucking crazy. I swear to god there were at least three times in his Naito match where I thought he had an actual chance of being seriously injured or even dying. I know all wrestling is dangerous, and no move is without risk, but taking a reverse rana off the turnbuckle could be lethal. Taking a pilediver off a table onto a concrete floor SHOULD be lethal. It just adds more to his character. \\n\\nHe has a fully dynamic character. What he does in and out of the ring is designed to advance that character. More importantly, that character is interesting. I want to know what he\\'s going to do next.  Other than trying to build interest in India, Jinder as WWE Champion really isn\\'t working (I did enjoy parts of his reign early on, but the main events of Smackdown PPVs have been awful). It\\'s not really a good standard to use. Plus, The whole idea of the Crusierweight Division is to allow smaller, more athletic guys to show off &amp; \"wow\" people. It might not always be working, but Enzo is the antithesis of what a Crusierweight Division is supposed to be.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t make it work, but it might also be the nail in the coffin for the division *if* the only reason to watch it is replaced by slower, more boring matches. Now picturing it:  \\n  \\n*\"I say, good chap, there seems to have been some confusion... somehow...\"*  \\n  \\n*\"Dear man, I may have made a mistake and am sitting in the wrong place!\"*  \\n  \\n*\"Heaven\\'s no, good sir, it seems that I\\'ve blundered in actually possessing the tickets for these seats...\"*  \\n  \\n*\"Say no more, bruv, we can enjoy the show from our real seats... thank you, fine fellow, for helping us clear that up...\"*  &lt;Benny Hill music plays as they scramble to their own seats&gt;    Fat guy trying to hide that he\\'s fat. So? I\\'m in my 30\\'s and would call myself a casual WWE fan. I never watched Nitro and didn\\'t recognise either of the women. We all have differing levels of interest, there\\'s no need to be an elitist jerk because someone doesn\\'t know everything you do. Upvoted. I\\'d like to know this as well. When he used to be a stud. IDK but all I know is New Japan World is definitely better than the WWE network and it\\'s gonna be great when NJW shuts down WWEN for good  Can\\'t tell you how many times I\\'ve gone to youtube with the intention of watching ONE thing, before you know it 3 hours have passed and I honestly don\\'t know how that happened except I have 20 tabs on my browser all from youtube. Jesus fucking christ.  I don\\'t claim to be an expert in anything but that sounds like the kind of thing that should result in criminal charges. So Corbin got heat by calling out a shit doctor on protocol on concussions?  Live sex celebration in the Tokyo Dome pls For anyone wondering\\n\\nhttps://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cum_1 They usually give it to somebody so they can take the next step up the ladder right WELP. Now I feel like an asshole because I always thought the blind people that go to my college were liars because they could cross the street when there was no sound near the streetlight.  Bobby Roode inaugural champ? Other way around. Joe was running wild and killing people, Angle debuts and confronts monster joe. This would\\'ve been like the next iteration, but with Angle already being there and seeing a similar pattern with Danielson.  Duhno. This.. his training regiment ....https://streamable.com/taic4 Flamita \"Raw is super easy to get through, at some point I binged watched 4 episodes without even realizing it.\"\\n\\nI completely agree with this. I watched ruthless aggression RAW and Smackdown\\'s and I just sat and watched them and because they were so easy to get through I did like 5 months.  Wasn\\'t sure, thanks! Don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re a resilient bunch. This is why I love long term booking or smart booking. The King of the Ring spot where Shane helps Kurt Angle keeps getting talked about but it\\'s so smart. When the show is booked weekly people don\\'t know what they\\'re doing or like the RAW before Summerslam, Vince wanted a title change so Neville lost the belt but they didn\\'t know what to do with the belt so it got given back to Neville True; just have to hope he\\'s back soon [Ref going at him like DeNiro in Goodfellas.](https://media.giphy.com/media/KXyKSpfcZ0GUU/giphy.gif)  Harper is a fucking gem. Now that this thread has been made, he will get booked on Smackdown this week for a job. Look at that skinny botchy child before CIMA beefed him up. Neville in his Junction 3 green gear really brings back those memories. He\\'s had some awesome theme too before the WWE, especially his DG theme.\\n\\nIt is really nice to see him be one of the best in the world and be a top 5 wrestler in WWE. That\\'s debatable I loved the Walter V Keith and 6 man tag way more  Being thrown up by Blake and Murphy allows Alexa to get some more height before landing the move, causing further devastation to the fallen opponent. I wouldn\\'t be opposed to him appearing in a non-wrestling role, and I fully expect we will see him show up again eventually. I do hope they hold off on it for a while but I wouldn\\'t be shocked if he shows up at Mania in some form. I don\\'t think there is anything more he has to give as a competitor but it\\'s one of the all time great erestling character so I would be totally ok with him still playing a part in storylines outside the ring. So on Justin\\'s \"two count\" he did count three from where I was sitting however the third smack hit Haskins in the shoulder  Great to hear! I haven\\'t watched any PWG, but as a fan of NJPW and Lucha Underground...I can\\'t miss this match. Yeah, I hate him too. What ever happened to Blake and Murphy? Are they both still in NXT as solo wrestlers? True, it\\'s fine to change your opinion but I do think some people lack patience and react too strongly without giving certain things a chance to unfold. I believe there\\'s a legitimate problem there that has to be acknowledged at least. Never in my life will I understand why people open so many tabs. Slapdick It’ll lose some heat if it’s live-streamed in a way. It’s a bit like Hamilton or Book or Mormon- seeing it live and in the right place is part of the appeal. It keeps the allure and mystery to it and forces people to pay $80 a ticket. A live-stream could break and fail, not to mention they’d have to mute or change how they do entrances entirely. 1. Make RAW 2 hours (I know it\\'s improved a lot but I would still like it to be 2 hours :D)\\n\\n2. More Freedom in promos, we\\'ve been seeing it recently and the promos have been great so I hope they start doing it a lot more often\\n\\n3. Make Backstage more organic, not just in a room that has the show logo on it. Then say no and be up front. Doing a your own PSA isn\\'t going to stop these people from doing it. This weekend was his debut in PWG. And if you\\'re an LU fan, Flamita was Night Claw for Ultima Lucha Dos. Before he thankfully went back to Dragon Gate to get away from some of bullshit of Octagon and AAA. He already had a break out year in 2014 in DG but is breaking out more in bigger indie promotions like PROGRESS and PWG. Shibata seems like a total bro outside of the ring. Read that as Sad Budd Dwyer. Which is a very different video.  I wonder if hangman has any issues going through airport security with the rope in his bags. in the words of Gallows and Anderson...LOL indie NERDS! \\n\\n\\nVince should buy pwg and make them all job to Roman Reigns..i would laugh so hard Oh! I was sad to see things didn\\'t pan out for him in LU, but it seems with all that has unfolded that was for the best. I\\'ll have to look for some other matches of his. At some point they\\'ll hit WCW levels of bloated. Maybe they already have. I think CIMA has access to the secret of the ooze Indians watch WWE on cable TV though.  Get Out Of Here, Stalker Wtf no lol no that site is so shitty and toxic..everyone complains there about WWE and nobody is happy with the booking or anything..why do they even watch.. Was hoping Trevor would win this year. The man has paid his dues especially at PWG, and has been the most consistent performer there for many years. Yeah. I\\'m sure he would\\'ve done fine in LU. But I\\'m much more happier seeing him again in Dragon Gate and other bigger indies around the world. Any singles match he\\'s had is worth watching whether it\\'s Mexico, DG or his PROGRESS SSS16 weekend. When they realised how much free publicity and positivity they could get by being friends with Meltzer! ;)\\n\\nOh no, the double whammy of questioning Big Dave *and* The Bucks!! Haha, what a totally unpredictable reaction on here!!! \\n\\n They were on Amazon when I got them, unfortunately it looks like they cracked down on it and removed it Probably just buys it locally if there\\'s any trouble A catalyst for arguments surrounding the body types of other people. \\n\\nEither that or young big lebowski. Hopefully we won\\'t see any \\'plants\\' though, like that nWo one in the cage I love the general rule of \\'everyone can put the boots in when someone jumps in the ring\\'.\\n\\nWhat idiot decides they want to get in the ring though, ffs?\\n\\nI will never understand these people! This just made me think.... Enzo is the complete opposite of Roman Reigns: Undersized, shows his abs constantly, never shuts up, gets the shit beat out of him and usually loses, and is over as fuck with te crowd. I dont think he\\'s gone hard since the 90s, and even then it was only for a decade or so in his 20s/30s. Flair has been flair for like over 40 years straight  Looking jacked real baby not a good pic considering he never won with it I expected Mc Cree somewhere..  &gt; and is over as fuck with te crowd\\n\\nWasn\\'t the booed, last time he cut a promo? Sorry if I\\'m wrong, but I am pretty sure he was booed I said this months ago, but--why isn\\'t Finn Balor challenging for the Cruiserweight title? Balor/Neville is a recipe for an EPIC series of matches and something really exciting. So kinda get a bit more Lucha Underground with it? That would be interesting to see wwe try to pull off. Didn\\'t everyone realize this?  I mean, Alexa was by far the most entertaining part of this trio.   How to make a guy who broke his leg countering a wristlock look good? What made Stone Cold so special was he firmly believed in his character of a beer swilling, anti authority, bad ass who didn\\'t trust anybody. If you were to judge him after his neck injury, purely on his ring work, he was fucking boring punch kick. Pre injury he was a really good technical worker. People try to say the neck injury was a blessing in disguise for him because it made him \"develop\" his \"brawling\" style which helped make him super over. He was over before the injury and all it did was limit him in the ring.  Source? I see nothing like that. 205 stones Seriously, if this sub did away with any kind of spoiler rule, the amount of quality discussion would skyrocket, and the editorialised not-actually-a-spoiler, spoiler-tagged clickbait posts would stop. Spoiler rules are subreddit stranglers, and they\\'re only in place because special snowflakes can\\'t exercise some common sense and stay away from a wrestling-themed message board until they\\'ve watched whatever show they don\\'t want to have spoiled. He\\'s a fat I wouldn\\'t call her overrated, just overpushed. As a fan from the U.K. I liked when he made sporting references from not just here but around the world. Often a lot (not all) people on Tv in the US seem quite un-informed about sports and other things outside North  America  You, sir, are the hero the WWE needs. But maybe with less surprise butt sex.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m curious how you remembered that number. I\\'m more the type who would use (RandomAreaCode)-382-5633.   You\\'re not implying they\\'d have Mauro doing color commentary next to Tim Phillips, are you?   That and the fact that she bumps like a goddamn champ Hang on...What\\'s the beef between Mauro and TP? If you fully get caught up with wwe I recommend branching out to other American promotions like gfw lu and roh &amp; Japanese companies es like njpw &amp; ajpw Whoa now. \\n\\nRight or wrong, it\\'s pretty stupid. There\\'s a doctor your company thinks highly of. They bring him to a talent meeting. The top corporate people from the office are there. \\n\\nHe gives a talk. You proceed to stand up and rip him in front of everyone. Even if your statements are accurate, that\\'s a Grade A dumbass move.  I believe William regal also mentioned this in his book. Where a technically superior wrestler has to lead a match despite the limitations of his opponent. I think his was vs Goldberg maybe.\\n205 should have Neville crush Enzo and then show enzo earning his spot. Like a shitty version on the zayn story from NXT If it gets Neville on the main ppv instead of the preshow it will be a success. That kind of strength, power, balance,  and agility all in one package is simply freakish. Oh god please no - Eliminate Vince\\'s silly rules for commentary and get him off the headset; they can be WRESTLERS, fighting for the CHAMPIONSHIP BELT, while occasionally drawing BLOOD, in front of the FANS\\n- New writing/booking staff that isn\\'t afraid of long term booking and ensures that everyone on the roster has something to do\\n- Allow for different wrestling styles so that the cards are much more diverse I still don\\'t understand what their gimmick is supposed to be right now. She is signed and has been at the Performance Center since May and she\\'s still doing them.\\n\\nI guess that answers your question. Shuffle--shu--shovel Jesus Christ, he\\'s too good to us mere mortals. We truly don\\'t deserve him. Much prefer Reigns to win the first match, use that to become no. 1 contender and best Lesner at Survivor Series. Then John wins the title shot at wrestlemania by winning the elimination chamber match.  #Hahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha This is terrible, but results in Cesaro winning the Rumble, and I\\'m high, so I\\'m on board.  Can someon help me? What did bamf stand for? Blake And Murphy...Falexa? Blake Alexa Murphy...Fight?  Replace Cesaro with Robocop and I\\'m sold. She\\'s 5\\'9\", but the way she carried herself and presented herself made her feel like she was a good 3-4 inches taller. Impressive job from her all around, IMO yay They sure liked putting that guy in a thong! Brooklyn was NOT too enamored with Amore, definitely.\\n\\nI was echoing the prior comment on that part, mainly.  His shine seems to be dimming, though. TMZ has a awesome video of george lucas telling people who do that to get a real job She should have pulled a Rush and walked away. e touo People still want cezzzzaro to be pushed LUL  I do when I\\'m playing Madden Mobile, NBA Live Mobile, Simpsons Tapped out. \\n cezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrtkooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hey instaed of shamusandcesaro it would be better if we got cesaRKO With orton and cesaro rite But charlotte had the talent + presence to back it up but even then I didn\\'t agree with it. I LIKE TO BIND! I LIKE TO BE BOUND! Wat was his name here WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT A MINUTE!\\n\\nTHIS COMMENT AIN\\'T ABOUT LOOKIN\\' REAL JACKED BABY! Imagine being this delusional Oh god, he just.. he just took out his snek and is pissin\\' all over the indie scene! taking a good match out of enzo, must be harder than taking that good match out of the 9 year old wrestling prodigy! Here\\'s a video:\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0820/630347/sasha-banks-booed-outside-her-hotel-video/\\n\\n(On mobile. Sorry) Didn\\'t South Park already do this with Craig and Tweek??\\nhttps://youtu.be/yhIS8pZ8CQk Don\\'t forget one of your best ones!\\n\\n* [Evolution of AJ Styles](https://streamable.com/m22z)\\n\\nKeep up the great work! Yeah, it takes time, but he\\'ll get there. My aunt had valve replacement, and was in hospital for 2 months, before and after surgery. However, she more or less made a full recovery, and is now living happily at home at the ripe old age of 80 What? What about anything I said was delusional?  Already posted. Why the average fan doesn\\'t welcome wrestlers with food and drinks?\\n\\nI mean why do they feel entitled to get something? I\\'d feel in debt for the many many hours of entertainment and I\\'d try to give something they could appreciate.\\n\\nCan you imagine how good Cesaro could feel with a whey protein jar and a letter of appreciation? No picture asked, no signed, just pure and simple giving.\\n\\nOr maybe a bottle of coconut water! After a long flight I think they\\'d appreciate it, especially because they say it\\'s hard to eat well on the road.\\n\\nI\\'d appreciate and I suppose they\\'d appreciate too. ... there\\'s so many \"Why?\"\\'s I have in response to this, it\\'s mind-numbing.   You think he\\'s better than Owens, Zayn, Rollins, Ambrose or Cesaro? its AWESOME is what it is that what miz said to me  Did Neville have a fucking caveman gimmick? WWE should really have some sort of Finance 101 course while guys are at the performance center. Just basic stuff like how to save money, invest smartly and retirement funds etc. \\n\\nA good idea would also to do some basic tax related stuff. I don\\'t know about US school, but In school they didn\\'t teach me a damn thing about tax and debt. I wish they did, cause it would have saved me a lot of headaches... I\\'m with you. Fucked up part is he looked BIGGER last show. Go to that fuckin performance center and workout for fucks sake. Look what happened to Mike Bennett. That\\'s just how Chet looks normally. No part of this program fixes the thousands of people in the crowds across the country booing Roman because they think it\\'s cool. Nor does it account for the fact that you can\\'t really book how people are \\'seen\\' at the end of a fued. WWE\\'s also taken turns beating the shit out of Roman over the last 3 years and that certainly hasnt helped, either. \\n\\nYou\\'re also going to have a helluva time swerving ANYBODY into thinking that Roman isn\\'t the face of the company --or in this case \\'going to be\\'--because he\\'s literally all there is full-time, too. TAKE MY MONEY. TAKE IT NOW  Thank fucking god. AXEL-MANIA!!!!! Nah all you need to be is better than slimeball, bully, blabbermouth and she is way better. Time for a women commentator revolution. I wish it was Triple H running SmackDown instead of Road Dogg. I didn\\'t get a SECOND chance to follow MY DREAM. Dude\\'s not giving a fuck it looks like. Oh was that the \"four ropes\" promo I agree that it\\'s Neville\\'s job to make Enzo (or any opponent) look good. I completely disagree that \"it doesn\\'t matter\", or \"that\\'s not his (Enzo\\'s) responsibility\" that Enzo isn\\'t good himself. A match is a two man dance, you can\\'t put all the responsibility on one guy\\'s shoulders. He\\'s not wrestling a blow-up doll. So if his opponent has the skill of a blow-up doll, the opponent should be to blame if the match sucks. Please. Just get wrestling married and celebrate by jumping of the ceremony balcony together into the honeymoon.  She\\'s more like the Trish Stratus to Blake\\'s and Murphy\\'s Test and Albert though. Who hasn\\'t she fought in the indies? kalisto and sin cara baybay Cesaro couldn\\'t make Enzo look good, so i doubt there\\'s anyone that can. Eating contest? Those two situations are completely different. Edge and Matt have talked about how even though they hated each other during that period, they never took liberties in the ring and tried their best to make their feud great. \\n\\nSexy Star could\\'ve seriously damaged Rosemary and considering her history of no-showing and being hard to work with, I don\\'t think you should pay her and give her a bigger stage to work on.  Yes They should get a woman on commentary though. Lita wasn\\'t half bad in the Mae Young Classic, I wouldn\\'t be against her joining SmackDown. Bray gimmick change to southern blues rocker.

Plus they are on strict diets most of the time. Ric Flair has had a hard time paying for things for 30 years. This isn\\'t a new development. This is wrestling mate.

Janela-Guevara was one of the best PWG matches I\\'ve ever seen. I can\\'t wait to see some of those spots on the preview when it comes out. \\n\\nAlso, it wasn\\'t Justin\\'s fault, Haskins changed the finish mid-count. You could tell Justin was pissed and knew he was gonna get blamed.  not the best shot of miz [He basically wrestled as Tarzan] (https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3182/2584919606_08955df117_b.jpg)\\n\\nEdit: Just noticed the other guy is Corey Graves, nice. Like that Bullet Club twonk last week, I don\\'t know where this sense that you\\'re entitled to time and attention from wrestlers comes from. There seems to be an attitude among a lot of people that wrestlers are somehow always working, that it doesn\\'t matter where they are, or what time of day it is, if you\\'re a fan and you appear in front of them, they should be happy to see you. It\\'s a genuinely crazy way to think, but it happens in wrestling, and with bands and other celebrities too. \\n\\nI always think it would be cool to see a WWE star out and about in Glasgow whenever they\\'re over here, but it\\'s never crossed my mind to find out where they\\'re staying or when they\\'re arriving so I can make sure I\\'ll get to bump into them somewhere.\\n\\nI also think that aside from the stalker mentality, the most worrying thing is that these assholes who turn up with dozens of photos trying to get autographs to sell on eBay are obviously making money out of doing it, because they keep turning up. That means people are falling for however they\\'re advertised, whether it\\'s \\'OFFICIAL WWE APPROVED SASHA BANKS SIGNED MERCH!\\' or whatever, people are giving these creeps money, and that allows them to keep harassing WWE stars. I don\\'t know how you solve that problem other than the wrestlers just getting together and deciding that as a group they should ignore these dicks and starve them of their undeserved income. SUSAN  Imho Sami is a bit too tall and heavy for the cruiserweight division. But Balor might be a really good fit. He\\'s basically already cruiserweight size, and he has the technical ability to hang with Neville. That match could steal the show on the upcoming WM if they go with it. Move to the Midwest, easy to get appointments since everyone is busy pretending everyone is fine. What even happened? Match was your typical snoozer PWG Haskins match, I stopped paying attention for a second then it was over. Public Enemy\\n\\nBray Wyatt\\n\\nShinsuke Nakamura\\n\\nThe Oddities\\n\\nKurt Angle\\n\\nBushwhackers\\n\\nSami Zayn He was clearly a dickhead, but I still found him enjoyable at times, especially when talking about Ellsworth. Actors are the same way. Would you buy a rom com with the lead actor being an overweight guy to the point where its obvious in his appearance if he\\'s a good actor? Maybe you would but most people wouldn\\'t. Wrestling is acting and they are playing a part.  Jesus christ, they booed her?! Noam dar holds literally every belt. e retired triple h, john cena, brok lesnar, da rok, an\\' hulk hogan. dey all held iz hand up an\\' gave I is flowers. monday night raw iz renamed monday night dar. he\\'s bin universal champion fe 5 years. e sometimes makes appearances on smackdown just to call shane da wee dafty. Agreed. This makes her seem like a caricature of a character and not particularly a good one. It was 1 production meeting overseeing creative on both shows where ideas would be pitched to Steph.  Oh God there is another! Two there always are.... Ya know, sometimes I wonder how people can have so little going on they do that for fun. Everyone knew Okada was the next Ace, didnt change anything during his feud with Tana That makes sense\\n\\nIt sucks, but it makes sense I\\'m right there with you.  I never thought he\\'d make it when he was on Tough Enough and being the host of Smackdown, or whatever he was in the beginning.  But now he\\'s one of my favorite heels, and one of my favorites on the mic.   nah id rather put TJP God I miss Batista Oh my god...how? Thats abit overboard with the dedication to wwe. It\\'s not like she had a lot of experience doing it. Yeah, apparently he got it at Unforgiven after a match during a match against Kane. I\\'ve never seen Murphy outside of the team and was never blown away by either guy. Could you recommend some matches of his i should check out? Wrestling is irrelevant in Argentina and when it wasn\\'t, it was a thing exclusively for kids. There\\'s definitely a fanbase (wwe sold out two big house shows already and they\\'re in october, i think) but you could never realise it\\'s there. And Vampiro isn\\'t even the worst commentator on that show! That was brutal! thanks man! and the number, its 423-GET-FAME from Lucha Underground/ Famous B.\\n\\nI revolve between that, Mike Jones (281-330-8004), and 867-5309 when i take people\\'s info and they won\\'t give a phone number.  Blake\\nAlexa\\nMurphy\\nFhrow? I don\\'t know the last one Check out his match with Nakamura, and his tag team match with Dillinger on the Australian show. i heard he\\'s wrestling cody rhodes for the roh title but i havent found confirmation is it just me or does that canadian destroyer sound like a move meant to destroy canadians as oppose to a canadian destroying his opponents they\\'re on different brands Doesn\\'t surprise me, Jericho was the hot new heel at the time and these plans would have been made before they knew Rollins was ready to come back Same with Great Balls of Fire. Maybe my favorite ppv of the last couple years.  WWE. They\\'ve more or less being entertaining and put on good shows, despite the awful Main Events. Got to love that some insecure idiot has gone on a downvote rampage in here, downvoting any comment saying people on this other forum are idiots. ikr, theres a thread like this every other day Good idea but I\\'d rather see Undertaker vs Kofi Kingston at Wrestlemania.  Man the hardys are so much more than a gimmick it\\'s super fucking infuriating listening to all you jackass es ramble on about how they need to use this gimmick in every single thread. I hope they never do. NJPW. \\n\\n\\nWWE isn\\'t even close\\n\\n A lot of fans love to use jargon as it makes them feel like they\\'re on the \\'inside\\' and not just fans. They\\'re just fans.\\n\\nNo matter what you read online you\\'re not \\'inside\\'.\\n\\nIt\\'s not as bad as that guy a few months ago, in a thread about Hogan refered to him a \\'Terry\\'.\\n\\nDoes it get mark-ier than that?! Well, don\\'t just blame the booking,  Brock\\'s probably got enough clout that he could probably speak up and say \"Hey, what if we worked a good match tonight?\"  Last I heard Murphy was doing a \"NXT\\'s best kept secret\" gimmick on the house show tour. Not sure about Blake. Crusty old vets that don\\'t respect the current generation Drink every time Vince says Cahoots and Conspiracy in 1998 I want her to come back for one more match to unify the women\\'s championship she never lost.  She looks like she\\'s in decent shape.  I always loved her as a kid.  new japan Santana Roll tide No I didn\\'t compare the two. I used them as two separate examples. I\\'m not sure where you got that idea from? For the record I didn\\'t state my opinion on Trump because it\\'s not what I want the conversation to be about but you have to admit his reputation is not what it was before his presidential run. Brooklyn hates everyone. AJs drop kicks when he was younger shits on okadas imho now he\\'s a little older he\\'s lost that spring, it\\'s not shit by any means but not as crisp as okadas now, like Okadas won\\'t be in a few years... Is Neville nattie? Why? It\\'s a perfectly legitimate use of the word cum.  *Modern day WWE guys. The heavy scripting is holding them back way too much  Thanks, man. I\\'ll check those out! Yeah Russo got everyone over, save for Austin, who was already a Main Eventer. &gt;69\\n\\nNiceeeee Mid 1999 is ropey as fuck but I love it because I have some fantastic memories from my teen years (The ministry, higher power all that nonsense) . Hang in there, things pick up significantly after Summerslam 1999 and set things up nicely for, what is in my opinion the best year in WWE of all time, 2000.  HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT Well if you think about it, each week, every thing they put on tv is all about generatingn few seconds of clips to use for the video package. Like you can almost always pick out those one or two lines in a promo that you know is going in the video package, or the one big move or surprise run in, and the rest is just filler, recognizing that makes Raw so much harder to watch. My point isn\\'t whether the Jinder decisions is a good one, just that if he happened no reason to assume Enzo can\\'t as well.\\n\\nAnd on the other note, I don\\'t watch 205live, but if their matches and promo are as boring as they are when they show up to Raw then I can\\'t see how Enzo is anything but a huge improvement.  I mean if you only watch Raw none of the cruisers have ANY personality.  Neville is just a generic angry heel.  Tozawa is interesting as an underdog but that\\'s all.  Cedric is bland babyface #5072, Noam is weird foreigner with a shrieky girlfriend, and none of the others really exist.  Enzo at least has charisma, a character to work with, etc.  And realistically the main division, at least compared to what the cruisers do on Raw when they get a chance, does more flips and high spots imo.  \\n\\nMaybe on the actual show all of the things I\\'ve mentioned are different, but from the perspective of the kind of fan they are trying to win over to 205live, Enzo is by far an improvement over any of the talent that show has right now in terms of entertainment. I love how WWE doesn\\'t try to cut the broken stuff. They are pretty much \"do what you want, just make sure it\\'s not gonna get a lawsuit from ~~TNA~~ ~~Impact~~ GFW\".\\n\\nI would have expected they do pretty much the same they do with everyone, telling them not to be what they were somewhere else, stop teasing shit, and be what WWE tells them to be.\\n\\nSo while it\\'s unlikely they ever get the rights for the gimmick, at least we get this and WWE is cool with it. Fat neckbeard^/s who can fight and also was Chris Hero. Somebody\\'s downvoting on here? I didn\\'t even know that you could upvote or downvote on here. Keep in mind, I got a Squared Circle account yesterday so I definitely do not know all the ins and outs on here. I\\'m going to have to read about all the rules and the stuff you could do on this site, besides the obvious (making a thread and replying). probably not. if it was up to me i\\'d hold off until wrestlemania and put the belt on him. making \"i\\'m not finished with you\" into his catchphrase has really pushed him over the top as the most enjoyable wrestler on raw A tv title that\\'s defended every week Thats the truest sentence ever spoken. What do you want to say with that? That\\'s how Kenny Omega calls his, but for one, it\\'s not the same move Seth uses, and for the other, he\\'s pretty much the only person who uses the move, so obviously there can\\'t be any other name for it yet than what he calls it.

Probably the best single year by a company in professional wrestling history and the year\\'s not done yet. 🍆🍆🍆 You really can\\'t tell with all the \"looking real jacked\" comments? &gt; Oh cool is this up on demand\\n\\nYeah. It\\'s one of my favorite matches this year (although I saw it live so I may be biased). That\\'s a fucking incredible get for New Japan, both guys could do a Rocky/Trent kinda thing where they do solo matches as well, and both guys are fucking incredible as a tag team. I\\'m all for this. Riddle in New Japan? Take my fucking money 7/24. wwe - Hart vs Austin - WM 13\\n\\nnjpw - Ibushi vs Nakamura - WK 9\\n\\nroh - Styles,Young Bucks vs Okada, Beretta, Romero - Global Wars 2015 It wasn\\'t you but the \\'1 point\\' for voting you see next to your name ... a fair few \\'0 points\\' down the thread on anyone who said anything negative about this forum, which I have never heard of tbh Did you even watch his match with Itami? \\n\\nSure he has a bit of a gut, but I wouldn\\'t say he\\'s either outdated OR out of shape. Wow what the fuck  Well, he at least gave them the chance to get over, he gave them a *reason* to be on the screen or in a match, etc and then or course there were a lot of talented guys.\\n\\nHe also wrote even those middling guys little storylines and reasons to be on screen too so it felt like we knew what everyone\\'s motivations and stories were Oh, so that is the thing that determines points. Thanks! Still trying to learn the ins and outs so forgive me if I end up screwing something up. You need cardio to lose fat, not \"lifting\".  I miss Blake &amp; Murphy. Such an oddball but fun tag team. &gt; using a foreign object\\n\\nThis technically means that Blake and Murphy are objectifying Alexa That was a good debut. he looked great. It wasn\\'t you doing it, it was someone else that saw these \\'negative\\' posts about somewhere they most likely post and downvoted.\\n\\nYou may think that other place was toxic, well, it\\'s not so bad here but the collective markout love for certain guys takes shape in the form of downvotes.\\n\\nAlso, don\\'t say anything bad about Meltzer, they don\\'t like that ;) Amazing work as always dude. I gotta ask, do you have a Patreon or anything? This is easily my favorite series of videos posted on here and would love to keep seeing more but I know it\\'s gotta be a time crunch. I\\'d love to be able to support in any way possible. Who would win in a shoot (insider term) fight? Big Dick Dave Meltzer or Lord Kevin \"functional muscle\" Steen? Can we get a sequel with Flair too? And Shawn, or anybody else that was on top for a long amount of time and held others back? Its not a bad idea actually but I think it can be expanded upon. It obviously would never happen because every guy back then is a saint with a bad memory haha.  Lanny has confirmed that him and Randy did make up. So Randy\\'s own brother has said they made up.  new japan Every 80\\'s star lies to everybody about everything.* She reminds *me* of Ivan Drago lol This I would like to see Oh yeah I know I didn\\'t downvote anybody because I didn\\'t even know there was a upvote, downvote system in the first place. Anyway thanks for giving me some tips on this place! Hopefully I can make myself comfortable here! :) I mean I don\\'t think she needs to go to PWG to win \"points\". She idolized Roddy Piper and was a \"Paul Heyman girl\". Thats more smark points than most indy guys could ever amass. Getting endorsements from those two.  You think Memphis is a small town?  This makes sense. His entire thing right now is lambasting everything everyone in the IWC loves, and saying he\\'s gonna give us all \"What we want\", I could totally see him becoming Diet Corey Graves. cena just rolls out lel Imagine if they combined the talent today with that kind of writing... Amazing signings by New Japan.\\n\\nBoth are great singles but with Riddle\\'s habits and Cobb\\'s erratic LU commitments bring them in as a tag means they don\\'t have to push them massively to begin with.\\n\\nRiddle can be a legit mega star in New Japan so I am so excited to see how he does. I mean maybe if you watched the show you would realize it\\'s filled with a bunch of storylines. then i\\'d put THE GREAT KHALI Don\\'t comment about it. Contribute to the discussion about the topic of the post rather than looking for a reason to be offended. Your comment is literally one of two that I\\'ve seen focusing on Trump being used as comparative to public perception of someone shifting. Now that\\'s out of the way, is there anything you\\'d like to see about the topic at hand? nah Jinder mahal vs undertaker No, he\\'s not ready yet. \\n\\nOne of the biggest letdowns this year is that they didn\\'t have anything for him at \\'Mania\\n\\nEdit: and for the people downvoting me right now, let me explain. While I\\'m a fan of Braun and think he has definitely improved there\\'s still a case to be said that they do a good job of hiding his flaws in ring. The fact that he\\'s basically worked with Roman the last 7 months is proof of this. And you can also add that there\\'s nothing for him to do on RAW. Even with a title. He\\'s run through that roster for a year and a half. I think he\\'s headed to Smackdown after this match with Brock Sick! I had something on that night and missed the show which was a real bummer (oh shit I remembered, I saw Death Grips hahah) but gonna pay the $$ to watch it tonight - cheers! Even better - if Jeff is really getting a singles run, have Matt revert to Broken and begin a feud with Bray, then have him bring out Harper &amp; Rowan as the remnants of a broken family. That feud can last for several months, culminating in Wyatt regaining control of the family in time to go after Braun.\\n\\nHell, they could ultimately reform the Wyatt family (bring Braun back into the fold), with Bray as the maddened cult leader who doesn\\'t care about titles himself, but wants to put the tag titles on Harper/Rowan and the World/Universal title on Braun so as to demonstrate the power of his family.\\n\\nCould even replay the Ministry of Darkness angle of 1998 with Bray trying to take power from Stephanie. Have Braun destroy HHH and then solidify him as a main eventer by feuding with Cena as the next stage. \\n\\nI\\'m picturing a feud where Cena takes on the Miz role - he wins every battle on the mike, but gets beaten every match in the ring, culminating in Strowman squashing Cena on PPV to end the feud.\\n\\nGiven how many people are on the roster now, this could enable Cena to finally turn heel again in order to recover some self-respect.\\n\\nThe end-game for Stephanie-Bray? Haven\\'t thought that far, but could conceivably be a total rehash of the Corporate Ministry with Shane being behind the family all along. It\\'s a fun storyline. Fuck off with that misogynistic trash dude. Men and women don\\'t experience anger differently, individuals all feel and express anger different ways, it has NOTHING to do with gender. I\\'ve seen girls kick a lot of ass and I\\'ve seen dudes so passive aggressive it makes my teeth sweat. \\n\\nSo yeah fuck you and this statement.  Nice to see some of the younger fans showing some love for the AE (which is rare on this sub).\\n\\nGlad you\\'re enjoying it! I was always a WCW guy myself but I will never deny that around 1998 onwards the WWE were firing on all cylinders. The television was absolutely riveting stuff. Everything had a purpose (even the dumb stuff), everything was so chaotic and unpredictable, you never knew what was going to happen next week and at the time, a lot like GoT and shows like TWD now, people would speak about it at college, school, even work the next day. The 90s was all very anarchic and edgy so although it hasn\\'t aged well to some, it was very relevant to the time. I miss it very much. I don\\'t really like the current product, I don\\'t like many of the characters and wrestlers, I hate the production and bland HD arenas, the storylines suck, I find the shows very by the numbers and dull, BUT, I have kind of accepted that I had \"my era\" and understand that many young people love today\\'s product so I don\\'t really complain I just stick to the old stuff on the network that I enjoy like the AE and WCW.\\n\\nOn a side note, hang in there through 1999. It\\'s pretty rough as fuck at times but it improves significantly after Summerslam and lays the groundwork for the god tier year of 2000 (the best period in WWE history imo, there isn\\'t a single bad PPV and the storylines were captivating that year and even better, the match quality improves loads).  Do you not know Brock Lesnar guy the super fan? Australian males. Australian males. I popped so hard when had the title after slamming brock twice on RAW. thought him with the belt was a good sight  Also in my Trump example, it has nothing to do with his politics. I\\'m using him as a celebrity figure. His TV and movie cameos were early in his career and the Access Holllywood recording was in 2005. Long before his even became a politician. Like I said, not ready yet. Still should be a fun match. I think they should give him a little while longer I second this. He talks about his WCW lil Naitch days, and tells some good stories. Plus he and Jericho discuss the time they got heated in the ring when Neville got hurt. Good listen. For a guy with nuclear heat, he\\'s getting a handy push right now. You need to not eat shit to lose weight. That\\'s it Ms. Money In The Bank using the briefcase to win the WWE Championship. Most people don\\'t like inter gender matches but I don\\'t see the fuss.  I\\'ll take the Halloween Havoc 97 incident after the Hogan/Piper cage match. Played out so well. Fan dressed as sting climbs in one side of the cage and gets tackled by security. Then like 20 seconds later Hogan and Macho man realize what\\'s going on and they go over and pull the dude away from security and beat the crap out of him while security tries to pull him away from Hogan and Macho. Yeah that\\'s a writers job. Although nowadays it\\'s all this scripted promo shit. hardly alexa and nias fault though. Which was followed by the crowd cheering him more. 423?? Tri-Cities?? Dragon Lee is something special ITS HAPPENING!!\\n\\nOh man I want Riddle so badly to be in New Japan, but Cobb too?? This is what dreams are made of.  Fucking hell fanboy, the guy was giving his completely fair opinion and sticking up for her. Are you seriously getting mad because he thinks the other horsewomen are better? Nak does a canny Shining Wizard. I\\'d like to see Hogan come out to a thunderous ovation --probably have to be Canada if we want it to be a guaranteed sustained ovation--that continues on as he stalls on the mic in the center of the ring. From there, before he can say anything, R truth, Booker T,  Mark Henry, New Day, Alicia Fox, Naomi, Ember Moon, Ron Simmon, Shelton, Kurt Angle\\'s Kid and Titus come out, one by one, entrance by entrance, and surround each side of the ring as Hulk looks on concerned and curious. \\n\\nAs they all rise up to the ring apron in unison, they look at eachother and then look at hulk and as they go to step in to the ring the lights cut out...\\n\\nIF YA SMELLLLLLL. WHAT THE ROCK. IS COOKIN.\\n\\nEverybody gets off the apron and back down to the floor. \\n\\nRock Comes out and does his corner to corner arm thing, giving Hogan the \\'fuck you, I\\'m rock\\' look he always gives everybody. He then cuts a promo recounting a pg version of the events that took place. Rock is clearly pissed of and calls everybody into the ring. \\n\\nHogan looks terrified. \\n\\nThe rock says the only reason they\\'re upset is because there\\'s a lot of confusion throughout white america about black america and the simple fact of the matter is this: \\'we hate niggers, too.\\'\\n\\nHogan, who still hasnt said a word, looks relieved that he isnt going to get his ass kicked and goes to lift his mic to say something. Rock cuts him off and goes down the laundry list of glorious shit that hogan has done to make wrestling, and everybody in it, what it is today. The whole 9 yards, inspired to say prayers, etc. \\'Hogan, you inspired the Rock to become the Rock.\\' and everything else the crowd has to pop for. \\n\\nTeary-eyed Hogan lifts the mic, again to say something but rock puts his hand over it as if to stop him. \\'But know this.. for all you\\'ve done, for all you will ever do, if you ever --AND THE ROCK MEANS-- EVER-- say that shit again, blah blah blah blah boots to asses and he hooks hogan and delivers a rock bottom. \\n\\nRocks music plays, the segment ends, commercials play and beyond recapping the fact that all the black folks picked hogan up and helped him to the back to receive medical attention, nobody on wwe ANYTHING mentions this shit for weeks. In fact, no one on wwe anything ever talks about this segment again. \\n\\nFrom this segment on, and this is first discovered by an xavier woods who\\'s partners were incapacitated and really in need of help to overcome an impossible situation, Hogan is a Run-In special move that black folks --heels AND faces-- can summon from the back (with a flexing gesture )in big matches where they\\'re outnumbered or when they just need to hulk up and get the job done. \\n\\nIn addition to that, WWE turns hogan into their Anti-Hate Speech, Always Tolerance guru and everybody wins.\\n\\nNow, reality being what it is, I can think of at least 10 major reasons why this would never happen, not the least of which being you have no idea if any segment of a crowd would attempt to start a \\'you said n*gger\\' chant, and I can think of 20 simple reasons why reddit would hate this...but I\\'ll be damned if it wouldnt turn into the most over \\'easy pop\\' shit ever, anyway, if it were to happen.  Firstly I\\'m a girl and everything about that post was pure LIES. Sasha is easily the most over female in WWE, and alexa is the one that botches the most basic of moves, meanwhile sasha has the best matchography of any woman in wwe history. And lmfao she\\'s done nothing on the MR? She\\'s the TOP female merch seller, a game-changing feud with Charlotte, some of the best matches the division has seen. First to main event a ppv, first hiac and multiple raw main events to her name.\\n\\n Like..I could go on, that post was clearly a troll which is why I didn\\'t even bother to elaborate in the first place. And I think you\\'re the one that needs to chill. It is their fault that they\\'re shitty wrestlers who care more about Total Divas than improving though I agree with Jericho in theory but in practice with 205 that kind of assumes it\\'s just like the main roster. WWE has its own set of conventions and methods and that\\'s fine but this is a brand sold on workrate, it kind of defeats the purpose of the tournament that started it and the credo the brand is built on - even if they barely follow it now.  Shades of Mrs Doyle in Becky\\'s performance here....\\nhttps://youtu.be/OOCAy7j2Vew Your last point is very true. My son is 8 years old and he can\\'t stand wrestling/WWE. He thinks the WWE is boring as hell and he\\'s mad into Marvel/DC and just general comic book heros and fandom in general and let\\'s be honest, who can blame him, they are far more imaginative and captivating for the young mind as everything in WWE is very.......... Dull and grounded lately? I mean, two guys pretending to practically kill each other week in week out really shouldn\\'t be taken so seriously so throw in some ridiculous over the top storylines to at least make it fun. \\n\\n8 year old me was obsessed with my superheroes Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Randy Savage taking on villains like Jake the Snake, Iron Sheikh, The Natural Disasters and then my teen years were with guys like Austin, Rock, a mental patient or whatever he was in Mankind, a transvestite rapey sex pest in Goldust a big burned monster in Kane and a walking satanist zombie in the fucking Undertaker Lol. They were over the top, larger than life and I absolutely loved every fucking minute of it :)  Save us from otunga. On one hand, she\\'s absolutely right.  On another hand, what business does she think she\\'s in? India. Mostly treated as a kids show.   \\nDuring the attitude era, many kids were not allowed to watch because it was (apparently) a bad influence. The chair shots to the head, blood etc.  I feel like people don\\'t just suck forever. It\\'s entirely possible to learn over the course of time. Do people on the internet not know how education and experience works?  *YAOI FANFIC INTENSIFIES* How does NJPW keep doing gold from everything this year? I thought i will not be iterested in world tag league, but Gedo got me again I\\'m just not a whinging cuntbag. \\n\\nIf they were camping up outside their homes m schools n shit.. Fair enough, at an airport? It\\'s a public space so who cares.\\n\\nYou don\\'t, however, also bother ppl with kids n family.  Ironically, I think Russo could do this \\'scripted promo\\' thing off much better than a lot of the writers now.\\n\\nI know he did weird stuff as well as good stuff but that was the crash bang TV of the time.\\n\\nHe did kind of think about situations from the \\'character\\'s\\' point of view so I think he could actually write \\'lines\\' if he needed to that are better than some of the rubbish they write now where everyone sounds the same Technically not big if true  Both help. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn. Some lifts can be great for overweight people too causing a high heart rate. Considering he was in a coma and had multiple surgeries, he\\'s not going to look 20 years younger or anything. He\\'s up, he\\'s wooing, and he\\'s doing fine it seems. Happy for that. [](/badjokecena) Is this a serious statement? Wow. How unironically discriminatory can you be? Why has Sami Zayn not won a Royal Rumble yet? He seems like the kind of guy it\\'s made for. A heel wins MiTB to sneakily cash-in and a babyface outlasts everyone to earn their pre-announced Mania match.\\n\\nPut Zayn in at 1 or 2 and have him win, it might sound like I\\'m oversimplifying something but it\\'s really a good thing to do. I don\\'t care so much for the winner as the rumble is good by itself. But talking about the four you said, only the 2016 rumble could be called \"a great Royal Rumble\" hmm... Well TLDR, they didn\\'t arm wrestle. They did a contest in lifting weights It\\'s possible but you\\'d probably also want to consider that wrestling is really fucking hard, some shit happens very quickly and not everything is absolutely perfect every single time.  What a sad sack of shit he is. Does he seriously have nothing to do with his life? Props to whoever posts a link to this match Neville can get a 3 star match out of a broom, so i expect at least 2 1/2 stars from a match with Enzo. Weird assumption to make, do you know them personally? I actually like the MITB and SD matches. Backlash was boring, except for the Singh Brothers getting beat up and Orton murdering Mahal for the first couple of minutes in the match.  Battleground was just awful.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow I didn\\'t know Jinder was hated so much that you could get downvoted for saying that he had some decent matches. I guess he can never have a decent match. Feel sorry for those weird people who go to such lengths just to interact/get autographs from their favourite wrestlers/celebrities.\\n\\nIt\\'s sad. Get fucking lives. The only two reasons the 2016 RR was more positively remembered than the others was because the title was on the line and they teased the crap out of Ambrose winning. Otherwise it fits right in with 2014, 2015 and 2017.  It got some memorable moments but still a part timer won. Dean Ambrose would\\'ve win it and WM32 Main Event would\\'ve been awesome.  The world is gonna explode from these two getting a stage like this No, Cornette is the type of asshole to wish bad stuff on Kenny. I\\'m all for it at this point. [I gotcha covered - should be up within a week for preorder](http://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com/merch/) :) This year\\'s Royal Rumble is the perfect rumble to win for Sami Zayn. They can recreate a Daniel Bryan WM30 Moment. It would be so good to see him win. New Japan\\nProgress\\nRoH\\n\\nI\\'m not overly familiar but from what I\\'ve read wXw in Germany are having a crazy year too! I understand where she\\'s coming from, especially the last bit about the people who just get autographs to make money on Ebay.\\n\\nThat said, though, this makes her come off poorly. She\\'s been a wrestling fan her whole life. She should know it comes with the territory. She\\'s had issues w/ mistreating fans lately, and then she wonders why she\\'s not getting the push she wants.  What the fuck. That is so awesome. These 2 may kill it in njpw. I read that as Eric Bischoff.... I am not a smart man. Imagine if the masked men were Damien Sandow and Wade Barrett, now aligned with Cena?  \\'Cause of the insane selling? Good lookin for the link+time, I\\'ll be sure to check back soon once someone buys it and uploads it :) Everything about Strowman is ridiculously over the top and it\\'s amazing. yeah probs It\\'s a great double positive that WWE is insane not to try, considering it\\'s what the criticize WCW in every documentary they have produced ever. Neville was great in those few days after he lost to Tozawa. He went full mad king. Him standing there at Takeover:Brooklyn with a blank soulless stare was great. I\\'d love to see more of that Neville.  I\\'m not a big fan of Balor, but he\\'s struggling to find a place right not post his injury. Putting in a cruiserweight division wouldn\\'t help him reclaim his status. Back when \\'gay\\' was constantly used as an insult, I would get pretty defensive about people I knew calling wrestling gay. Now I\\'m more invested in this wrestling being gay than anything else going on in wrestling right now. Except he\\'s got no one to tag in now so how can he pull it off? Don\\'t forget Deeb vs Asuka/Kana.https://youtu.be/WffeQY8SP3c I will go down with this ship &gt;[**Kana vs Serena [15:00]**](http://youtu.be/WffeQY8SP3c)\\n\\n&gt; [*^ConXa*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKre6F7xu3jzbx2R6MBjzug) ^in ^People ^&amp; ^Blogs\\n\\n&gt;*^16,677 ^views ^since ^Jun ^2015*\\n\\n[^bot ^info](/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index) Greatest wrestler in the WWE right now. I do miss some of his flippy shit sometimes, but he makes up for it with his character work and brutal heel wrestling style, it was probably a smarter move to slow down a bit, hopefully he can get a ton more longevity wrestling the way he is now. The real problem is their voices don\\'t have any strong defining quality.  Corey, Cole, Lawler, JR, JBL, Tazz, almost all of the commentators we\\'ve had feature voices that are recognizable.  I often just assume JBL does commentary with one other person that that inhabits two bodies because those two don\\'t have any distinguishing features in their voices or personalities to make them relevant or memorable. Chill swell dude If it\\'s filled with passionate people, you don\\'t need to hold a conversation. It\\'s chaotic like a real crowd.\\n\\nVGCW is the best example. Mass singing of entrance music, spamming memes, counting along with the referee, SCREAMING when people hit their finishers. Yelling \"HEART\" after a big kick-out, etc. Riddle\\'s habits?  Good luck, no one uploads PWG shows online. DVD sales are their only source of income and for the quality of the promotion people don\\'t post full matches. He really likes weed  Sooo true Holy shit! If you can find recommended matches/feuds, I\\'d probably recommend watching selectively. But then, I\\'d also recommend that for the Attitude Era and current WWE. You enjoy it more without the filler, like an anime. He really likes strangling innocent woodland creatures. It\\'s so great to see a fellow Adelaide boy in Jonah Rock getting such a big opportunity and grabbing it by the balls, especially being asked to come back by the fans after. I hope this is the start of something truly special, not just for him, but for the South Aussie wrestling scene as a whole. 2000 is a good fucking year for wrestling Criminal that Sami hasn\\'t won a title after being on the main roster for a year and a half. Brooksy is the best, just such a supreme shit talker. Not everyone (at least, for WWE) - Cena, Ambrose, Miz, Owens, The Usos, New Day, Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, even Rusev to an extent are all good at promos. Not all at the same level of course, but they\\'re all at the very least good (and in some cases, excellent). I felt that way about The All Night Express... I think I just hate Rhett Titus for some reason. Good bot. I never want to see Undertaker wrestle again. I want to enjoy the match, not feel really bad watching a wrestler in agony and barely capable of moving. Is this what it feels like to be one of those creepy obssessive tumblr girls who ship real people together? I miss Kingpin Dean. Smackdown just isn\\'t the same without him and Miz running the show with AJ. More like \"When Fans Get Attacked\", am I right? &gt;\"I was right about Enzo Amore\"\\n\\n&gt;- Roman Reigns\\n\\nBut really, you\\'re spot on about it all. I\\'ve all but given up creating a parent comment nowadays. I just respond to people with similar opinions, because it\\'s safer.\\n\\nI mentally critique my favorite wrestlers much harsher than ones I\\'m not interested in, and if I happen to critique a favorite here, it turns hostile. It\\'s crazy to me.  Because they did that. David Otunga would like a word. /r/scjerk is the only good wrestling board. /r/squaredcircle and wrestlingforum.com are equally terrible. Thanks Regal. Someone get the Yuri on Ice team on the phone. He\\'s really the best at playing the cocky, chickenshit heel. I think they got it right when he inherited the figure four from Ric Flair. I believe it was a chandelier. Some of those guys look like they literally just woke up. He\\'s a very emotional/passionate wrestler. His performance could use some refining and toning down at times, but sometimes it feels like how it felt to watch Shawn Michaels at his best. There\\'s something so captivating and attention grabbing about it. Kind of show off-ey/self-centered in a way, but he has the substance to make it worth paying attention to. But they also did that with Corey Graves. You can\\'t say giving people a chance is never a good thing with that card on the table. Yeah, you might get another Otunga (205 Live guy being MiniCole doesn\\'t help things), but you might get another Graves. If the reports of multiple organ failure are true then this is a total miracle.  &gt;solo matches\\n\\n\\nishii vs Cobb might actually happen and I\\'m rock hard thinking about it He\\'s one of those guys that cosplays without a shirt, ugh. Or maybe Battleground 2016 , ita probably the best thing WWE did Yeah I preferred Have a Nice Day. Couldn\\'t stand The Hardcore Diaries though, seeing Mick so angry at Vince, wrestling, fans and family was depressing. He spoke so highly of these things in his other books and I think he was depressed or beat up or something, but reading him bitch about his wife and fawn over Melina for the whole book was disturbing. I wish mods hadn\\'t caved and unbanned DabTJP. Now we\\'ve got more \"\"\"\"\"\"hilarious\"\"\"\"\"\" novelty accounts pretending to be mentally handicapped and posting in bad broken English Yes, \"perfectly closed\". They keep getting these gimmicks in the mail They would kill each other.  Bro that\\'s disingenuous as shit. PAC was always leagues ahead of flippy-shit dude\\'s like Ricochet or Jody Fliesch or Amazing Red or Sydal or the Bucks or honestly any of his contemporaries.\\n\\nThe only one to really rise to the, ahem, Neville level, has been Ricochet. Early Ruthless Aggression era is pretty good. Cena-Edge feud (2006) is pretty good, check out Batista-Undertaker feud (really really good) they had really good matches, DX-Rated RKO feud, Shawn Michaels-John Cena\\'s amazing match on Raw April 23rd, 2007 (?), ECW One Night Stand where Hammerstein pretty much is about to kill John Cena, Wrestlemania 25 Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker (my favorite match of all time), 2007 at Backlash Fatal 4 Way between Michaels, Edge, Randy Orton and Cena is the greatest Fatal 4 Way ever imo.  Njpw/roh. No one can touch their momentum right now, matches people actually want to see, rather than what\\'s pushed on them. Nope, but a young talent benefitted from main eventing WM with him so swings and roundabouts really  Helms should come back, full stop.\\n\\nNot as talent even but trainer or agent. I always enjoy listening to him and seems a switched on guy and loves wrestling XD I apologize I didn\\'t express my self correctly. I should have written perfectly sealed. Cool. And who\\'s gonna singh? \"Kassius Ohno is fat but seriously guys, Kevin Owens looks like a tough dude and not pregnant at all.\" At least he tried to smile. He\\'s dead, but he tried. ...that\\'s when you discover the \"fan\" has cleverly disguised the needle hole under some black marker print... and wait.. this does taste a bit odd... right...? Lol at that dig at Edge.  No one should have to endure stalking, end of story. No room for debate here imo.  And as for her push, that\\'s just pure incompetence on WWE\\'s part. The first two weeks was constant pain. But after the last two weeks or so it has been better. Bumping used to hurt for days afterwards but now I just wake up the next morning a little sore.\\n\\nTwo reasons why bumping is a little better for me now is my body is building a tolerance to throwing itself to the ground and I have two amazing trainers who REALLY know how to bump well, safe, and make it look devastating. So they have drilled the proper way to do it into my skull and my body thanks them for it.  Melbourne City Wrestling i imagine the \"fights\" at pwg shows consist of morbidly obese 35 year old men swinging rick and morty backpacks at eachother while telling everyone to check their privilege and crying I\\'m starting to think that Jeff will lose and then Matt will challenge the Miz and be the Intercontinental champion. If the company tells Cena to bury Corbin, then why is it Cena\\'s fault? It wasn\\'t Cena who booked the match\\'s length, the result, or what would happen. Even Jericho would have done the same if the company told him to.  This post has been removed for being a meme, which are not allowed in /r/SquaredCircle.

Before realizing that the winner is a celebrity.\\n\\n\"Oh no... what have we done?\"  Watch from around September 96 to September 97 and give us your thoughts.  And also AJ debuting as well. This indie guys do too much I run a gym and my office has some framed njpw cards, a Cena signed cap and some figures. Never fails to raise the eyebrows of people who like to tell me \"Oh you like wrestling? My 12 year old brother watches that\".\\n\\nTo be fair one of my friends who I met through there bonded with me over the cards and recently bought me a G.O.D shirt from when he went to G1 semi final I\\'m surprised they they didnt make getting in better shape a condition before signing him.\\n\\nI dont know what his goals are in coming back to NXT, but the main roster isnt one of \\'em judging by his commitment (or lack thereof) to his look. &gt; Everything is so non-organic and too scripted.\\n\\nTotally agree with you, on all points. These days, I feel like I\\'m watching an informercial. I got three months of the Network for free, I\\'m binge watching a lot of 97-99 stuff from all promotions, back then I was a WCW guy, but now I\\'m mostly enjoying the WWF. It\\'s highly addictive television. Should would probably do fine as the third wheel announced but she is kind of in her perfect spot now. Lead Interviewer and host of pre/post shows seems perfect for her. Nah [listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy04yJmmlR0) he should show up on 205 Live in the first row of seats wearing a suit, glasses and that beanie cap of his when he was a heel. The announcers could bring attention \"Do you know who that is? Thats Gregory Helms, what is he doing here?\".\\n\\nDuring a match both competitors are outside the ring near Helms, the heel throws the babyface into the barricade and he goes flying over into Helms. The face gets up and jumps over the barricade but before he can enter back into the ring Helms jumps him from behind and then leaves through the audience.\\n\\nThe following few weeks Helms appears here and there, interfering in matches always attacking the faces. After the fourth week someone catches up with him when he is leaving the arena in the parking lot and interviews him.\\n\\nHe goes on to claim he is a future wwe hall of famer and demands respect, I am a cruiserweight legend. All I see here on 205 Live is a bunch of garbage not worthy enough to carry my bags let alone face me in the ring.\\n\\nHe is then challenged by the Faces he attacked, one by one they call him out in the ring. Helms does not respond in person instead he does another interview where he is asked \"Will you accept so and sos challenge, ect.\" Helms says \"Challenge, what challenge? I\\'m a Cruiserweight Legend there would be no challenge besides I\\'m retired, awaiting my Hall of Fame induction.\"\\n\\nEventually management would persuade him to come out of retirement for a Cruiserweight Championship opportunity, a number one contenders match. Helms signs a contract without reading it thinking its a singles match and unaware of the opponent.\\n\\nIt is then revealed to him its a Elimination 4-Way and his three opponents are the babyfaces he attacked the prior month. He tries to weasel his way out but is forced into the match by security. His three opponents work together beating him up and chasing him around the ring eventually he takes a finisher from each of them. Fortunately for him he is not pinned, instead he lays ringside the rest of the match until the finish.\\n\\nThe Faces fight and eliminate each other, there is one guy left he goes grabs Helms who is still laying lifeless outside and tosses him into the ring. As the Face climbs through the second rope Helms rolls in up whilst using the ropes as leverage.\\n\\nHe goes on to face Neville for the Cruiserweight Championship, it appears Helms is going to win he is setting up Neville in the vertabreaker but one of the three babyfaces he pissed off, their music plays and all three appear at the top of the ramp. Neville reverses the vertabreaker and retains his championship.\\n\\nHelms then goes on to face those babyfaces in singles matches and loses all three matches clean, after his final match he is interviewed and angrily says he going back into retirement to await his hall of fame induction.\\n Generic nxt wrestler but fat Prince\\'s Throne is a better finisher than the Bloody Sunday tbh And every time the top comment is \"I think it is after he wins with a Rainmaker\" Riddle and Cobb have both had incredible years. Hope they both thrive in new Japan.  Exactly. To add to your point, I was always a comic book nerd, and part of the reason I love wrestling is the characters. Back then, wrestlers were better, more developed characters. Why would an 8-year-old today watch Seth Rollins deliver one of his monologues, or could a kid appreciate a Cena/Roman smark promo? I don\\'t care about that shit, and I\\'m an adult male who has been watching wrestling since 1989. Thyroid issue depends what you define as wrestler. to me its the whole package and not having strong English skills does hinder her, for me at least. Promos are important I feel and it helps me invest in the wrestler. In ring she is great, but on the mic she has a lot of work to do. 20 Double Cheeseburgers the strip was despite them having no cheese on them.\\n\\nThis PPV along with Judgement Day \\'03 where some of the only tapes I owned back in the day. So he\\'s Mark Harmon in Summer School? get it signed by Ryback. Sometimes life is alright yknow Not sure if this is going to be a success or a failure if I\\'m honest. Riddle has said multiple times he \\'needs\\' weed for medical reasons and Japan is one of the strictest countries in the world when it comes to drug policies. I think it would have been better to bring them in for a shorter tour to test the waters, a long and rigorous tournament like the tag league whilst trying to handle his issues could be a serious problem for Riddle.  I\\'m also watching the Attitude Era right now, and I watched it back then, too, and I can say I don\\'t mind about the workrate. I\\'d gladly trade today\\'s workrate for the overall package of the Attitude Era. I can\\'t care about workrate in a match I don\\'t care about.  This promo actually makes me kinda bummed that we didn\\'t get to see Punk vs HHH at Wrestlemania 30. While it led to Daniel Bryan\\'s big moment, imagine the promos between \"I\\'m beat up, I have staph, and am SERIOUSLY so over this place\" CM Punk and \"Me and my friend Mark\" HHH. I know, I\\'m right there as well! Oh man. Whoa whoa whoa whoa.... LaVey had a Van Dyke, Taker\\'s Ministry beard is known as the Anchor. Yes, I Googled it to be sure. My favorite Taker is 97-98, right before the Ministry. Yes. And another move set or atleast new moves \\n\\nThis demon has so much potential My only memories of him involve him hitting other Bears and never their opponents.  Found Brock Lesnar guy\\'s account. Russo being a troll. I suspect some found it annoying because he was typical Russo \"drama over in-ring work.\" I liked Right to Censor, too. They at least had a decent run Neville gonna be hitting that red arrow on himself  Neat. Get to see myself at the Liverpool show again Ok all of you are right, no food and drinks I get it.\\n\\nMy message was simply this:\\n\\nWhy do fans feel the need to ask for something? Shouldn\\'t be nobler to give the wrestlers something?\\n\\nThere\\'s a certain level of risk in anything, I naively thought that giving food could be a good idea, but yeah it\\'s dangerous.\\n\\nMore than anything I learnt that fans should give what wrestlers need, not what they feel wrestlers could find useful or pleasant.\\n\\nWrestlers want to be left alone, and we as fans should leave \\'em the fuck alone. It\\'s been months and they\\'re still not over the ....dive thing. The joke got old a while ago. Who also has an OD for liquor Of course not. You can have all the talent in the world but unless you\\'re booked like it, with the current top guy putting you over, there\\'s going to be a ceiling on your stardom. It\\'s similar to what Tanahashi did for Okada. Here\\'s hoping B&amp;M get back together to defend NXT with Drew McIntyre. \\n\\nOr anything to be honest. Put em back together. He\\'s basically doing the Broken thing without using the word broken. I\\'m completely skeeved out by those pictures. I\\'m not okay with stalking these folks. I don\\'t think anyone has a right to their time. My point was that the argument that the assholes selling the product online are \"too lazy\" to get a real job is silly. Maybe I just hate airports and 4AM than some people but that seems like a really tough gig to me. They need to build Sami Zayn up first and actually have him win feuds before he\\'s even close to being at the point where he can main event Wrestlemania. Dude\\'s only been on the main roster for like a year and a half. Everyone should go and watch the Jumbo/Fuchi/Kabuki vs. Misawa/Taue/Kobashi match from May 26th 1990, less than two weeks after Misawa unmasked. Jumbo is being a real asshole to the younger guys, and finally Misawa gets mad and smashes him with a forearm. Jumbo sold that thing like he\\'d been hit with a brick, and for the rest of the match is clutching his head like he\\'s got no idea what just happened. \\n\\nBy the time they have their legendary match at Budokan two weeks later, Jumbo has already established him as a threat just by how he sells a simple strike. And then Misawa pins him, after an all-time classic match in an exciting new style that Jumbo had innovated with Tenryu the year before. Misawa might not have been a made man at that point, but he was certainly a big fucking deal. A month before, he was still just Tiger Mask II. And Jumbo has to take a huge amount of the praise for that massive and rapid change.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t the end of Jumbo\\'s role in getting Misawa over of course - their incredible series of six-man tags through late 1990 and into \\'91 kept it going, including Jumbo tapping to a front facelock from Misawa. But those first few weeks were so crucial, and it couldn\\'t have happened without Jumbo. It will drag on to mania.  Kota\\'s FB relationship status: It\\'s Complicated with Kenny Omega That\\'s just wrong... That\\'s the catch with him not injuring anyone No he did not :) Sneky snek in disguise. Well I am not recommending he follow through.  I have to be honest I\\'m shocked he didn\\'t just do it or not and never speak of it to the general public it\\'s really funny he posed that question to a bunch of people. Also it\\'s not his daughter but a really odd situation Unpopular opinion, but I think the RA was better than the AE. Though I did grow up on RA so I\\'m biased lol. You just had all the top WWE and WCW/ECW stars during that era and the rise of Cena/Orton/Edge/Batista amongst a few others. It was a very cool time if you start from WM18 up to 2008-ish. Kevin Owens has a bit of fat, but he just hides it well. I think that\\'s the problem with Ohno, he has a not-so-form fitting shirt that doesn\\'t do him any favours. Holy shit I want this. Having Enzo beat Neville in a last man standing match could work, emphasising the fact that Enzo just won\\'t stay down. What? That\\'s impossible. Ain\\'t nobody man enough to feel the pain. Do you think that we, as an audience, are almost kind of expected to take Enzo\\'s move to the Cruiserweight Division as a sort of \\'reboot\\' to Enzo Amore the in-ring competitor, even if they keep his character the same? Like, forget Enzo and Cass, forget the min roster stuff, and just kinda take Enzo as new, on 205 live etc?  I would put it in the top 3 worst WWE title matches in WM history. It was garbage.  Tyler Bate is not mortal... Only one if Shawn  Michaels does  it first.   thanks I prefer ridiculous than stale and directionless stuff. I enjoy jinder actually. I appreciate you two for making coffee come out my nose first thing in the morning. Well done.  Where the titties at? He doesn\\'t even have to quit, he just has to not be an asshole about it and do it in Japan, simple stuff really. Wouldn\\'t have been an issue if Sydal didn\\'t do it in Japan like a dingus. i mean i think it\\'s a dick move to do that, but people pay for that stuff, so I understand why someone would set their morals aside, it\\'s easy money to make, you literally just have to get a signature of someone famous and you can make some cash, they wouldn\\'t do it if people didn\\'t buy these things https://youtu.be/IvFvv13hIuk.    \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/ADGR2bxLm34.    \\n\\nThese are two videos and two channels that I found very interesting. Honestly I feel weird and bad even sharing one of them because it\\'s such a dark topic but it really blew my mind that it was just overly discussed some people even try to discredit Roddy Piper as if he had truly lost towards the end and he was just a Ramblin crazy old man but I don\\'t think he would claim something like this if it wasn\\'t true.  \\n\\nI wrote that in a roundabout way because I thought if I led with what it is people would be shocked and think I was lying but Roddy Piper accuses Pat Patterson basically using his position on the card to obtain sexual favors from Roddy Piper. \\n\\n\\nThe other one was a pretty cool video about.  the background story of Kevin Nash and Hulk Hogan feuding.   This was the first video Lol how has no one heard cum used in this way. It\\'s not just a word for jizz guys This should have been Ellsworth\\'s gimmick. Imagine him constantly running out to try and save babyface\\'s. Only to get his ass kicked. Booking. The indie thing won\\'t elevate him into being a star because none of them are stars. They go into NXT from the indies and the smarks fawn all over them. When they go to main they may as well be a hole in the side of the road.  Wait your 8 yr old hates wwe? Well then all those pg stuff is useless as i wonder how many more children actually hate wwe. So much for \\'kid friendly\\'. Wait, wtf??? What post was this??  He can\\'t cut a promo to save his life and his psychology is flawed.  He might think himself the new Shawn Michaels but he definitely the second coming of Billy Gunn. Give me Cobb v Okada I think his promo style fits his character. He tends to be shouty, angry and to the point, and isn\\'t that kinda how he is in the ring? I\\'m not sure if it\\'s too early to put the Universal Title on him, but WWE tends to rush things these days. Which is why Cena vs Reigns isn\\'t a WM match when it really should be. I think Brock Lesnar will retain, but he won\\'t beat Strowman.  Well he\\'s the current Atlas champion and they did have the IWGP Heavyweight Tag Champions appear on back to back shows with the belts. He absolutely did, and Bossman ended up getting some of the glass under his eyelid IIRC. I know he\\'s been in hospital but god damn does he look thin in the face/gaunt. 50-100 year olds in your country don\\'t pay for anything? So there\\'s no concept of saving for retirement at all? To each their own, I\\'m just not entertained by him *shrugs* Personally I think her promos are great. She comes off as super intimidating a lot of times and she can say a lot without speaking a lot This isn\\'t really an unpopular opinion among the online fandom.  Damn that raw ring apron and the 2002 set. I forgot that they used that ruthless aggression raw set whilst still bring the wwf for a short while  how does one watch cmll Yes, please, let\\'s have Kevin Owens cut a promo in French, with English subtitles. Why did Marty feel the need to write that publicly... Are... are you implying that $1,500 for a *fucking childbirth* is **high**?! I couldn\\'t care less about Nia vs Alexa. Hopefully they don\\'t go that route and make it a triple threat match with Sasha. Man, I haven\\'t heard the WRP thing mentioned in years! I was one of the people who got sucked in and wasted my money on that Kickstarter.  Anytime Otunga is mentioned that\\'s the only line I can ever remember him saying. God he\\'s awful.  You paid for it via taxes, bud. Very unselfish of him to give Owens his spotlight.  That\\'s the problem. You have giant dudes who can move. We aren\\'t in the days of the great khali or Andre anymore. Braun can do a kick up, assisted by he big show, but even assisted is fucking crazy. So tiny guys doing flips isn\\'t as spectacular, even if technically they are. Dusty Finish... You won\\'t find any disagreement here. He works great inside the ring and flying out of it. Nothing about him says he shouldn\\'t be getting a push. The roster is bloated, storylines are tied up, and creative is losing it.  Harsh but true.  Oh boy. People that have never wrestled a day in their life are going to have a big problem with this. Definitly good ol\\' 82. He had it all and was just killed constantly due to bad booking. He is missing a time machine and mind control to go back to when he was on fire, any of the multiple times, and make the people in charge to let him rock it. \\n\\nI, sadly, think it is too late. I also don\\'t even think he cares anymore for some reason. Yeah but it doesn\\'t get Jordan\\'s over without saying Jordan.  I teared up man.  You will honestly find the same exact stuff here. The difference is the downvote function pushes that stuff lower down the page than most people prefer to scroll, and in /new. Me personally, I avoid the frontpage usually because it\\'s too cluttered with overdone gifs, so I think those of us who hang around /new have a slightly different view of how much horrible content is actually posted here. \\n\\nBut yeah, besides Twitter and Tumblr where you can selectively build your own wrestling community, this is my favorite open forum on wrestling.  I\\'d argue the roster size is right but the booking is wrong, you need a big roster just in case of injuries. What I would do is exactly what the WWE did years ago in the attitude era, that was have people rotate off TV regularly. So they had the big guys every week and then you had guys coming on randomly and then getting pushed for a few weeks or months to go off TV again. If you have a title you are on TV almost every week but if you don\\'t you work house shows, work dark matches and wait to be rotated on/off. It gives a chance for gimmicks like for instance Bray Wyatt to breathe. If he only showed up 4 times a year for meaningful storylines and he actually was a threat the dude would seem like a monster. Instead they have random feuds against random people and it seems stale even when he is a good character.  Yeah thats the point. Except im a different guy  For some reason I like that you have it as *the* shovel and not *a* shovel. You want to stifle innovation and progress in healthcare? That\\'s literally the *last* place I\\'d want to stifle it.\\n\\n Being good at something other than drastically overselling  They seem like perfect fits, Riddle especially.  Once me and my brother *saw Dolph Ziggler at an Airport, I\\'m a pretty shy guy and didn\\'t really have the confidence to approach him. But he joined the same food line as us and I mustered up the courage to say \"Last nights show was great, loved your match\"\\n\\nHe said Thanks and gave me a fist bump, honestly one of the coolest moments in my life for me and I don\\'t think it inconvenienced him.\\n\\nJust be cool people, god damn! \\n\\nEDIT: Grammar One of the reasons Riddle was keen on NJPW is that it allowed him to still to indie dates, so I would assume he would still be able to head over to PROGRESS I never said they should not lift weighta. But cardio is vital to shifting excess fat. Oh come, for like two years he was the absolute best at just screaming any time someone put a mic in front of him and trying to cram in a bunch of dog whistles for the smart crowd to try to get people into him. When I was leaving Barclays after SummerSlam, there was a bus with the wrestlers leaving the arena sitting at a red light. The amount of people going up to the bus and knocking on windows was alarming. Some guys even stepped in front of the bus to try to stop it from driving. Some people are just idiots.  Please watch late 96-1999 wcw next.   He\\'s not a personality in the ring either. I wasn\\'t watching when he was here originally. But he screams mid card big man  I absolutely cannot believe that that\\'s the guy who currently calls NXT. He doesn\\'t look like the same person. good bot How about a really generic mask? /s I don\\'t think it hurts anything. It\\'s just different brands of the same product and you choose your brand. It\\'s like Cereal. Or other streaming services.\\n\\nHulu, Amazon, Netflix, HBO and so on. You just pick what is attractive to you and pay for it. I don\\'t think it dilutes anything. \\n\\nWrestling still has a huge problem they need to fix with being able to see their live shit in easy ways so it hasn\\'t gone far enough in my opinion. You think paramedics work for free? You think ambulances and medical equipment grow on trees?\\n\\n(Hint: you pay for ambulances too.) I liked her in NXT solely because her voice was different and I can never tell the voices apart of the dudes.  I\\'d like to see this version because he wasn\\'t showing either of those recently.  But when Kevin Owens does it, it\\'s a \"totally savage burn!\"  Didn\\'t Triple H almost lose to Taka Michinoku? I think its well established in kayfabe, no matter how good you are arrogance can be your downfall. Back when Dean used to be jacked  Additionally, due to certain guys\\' contracts, they can\\'t live stream a show with the roster they have. Anyone with an Elvolve or ROH contract becomes unavailable, so that would be a bummer. \"Without us you wouldn\\'t be here!\"\\n\\nThis fucking guy. Scott hall and Kevin Nash for the NWO, if Hogan returns that is. No problem. My favorite part is where they\\'re watching the scene where Mark Henry realizes he\\'s fondling a transexual. The host is obviously appalled, but you see Vince laughing throughout. The way it is shot portrays him the way he exists as a meme today. It has been deleted! Interesting characterisation. He hasn\\'t changed anything but trunks to tights &amp; face to heel in the last 5 years.  They were probably sleeping on the plane. I know I would be if I had a job as demanding as theirs. \\n\\n&gt;It\\'s \"FOURTH, you are the worst writer of all time.\" I expect you to at least possess the intellectual capacity to recognise that the number 4 comes after the number 3\\n\\nGo back and read your original reply.  You can\\'t even tell when your poor writing is being mocked. Chyna at the time was established as an IC-level competitor. Enzo is established as a running gag.\\n\\nWhile making Chyna look good might have been a challenge, it wouldn\\'t make Jericho look as bad as Neville would trying to make Enzo look competent. Jesse Ventura was trying to organize a strike but Hogan sold him out Yeah and it cost Jericho 1000 dollars iirc I\\'d like to see them turning the incident into a story line to enhance Rosemary\\'s unhinged character, but not involving Sexy Star getting any kind of a payday, or making any sort of appearance. Just Rosemary getting hurt during a match, and how it\\'s made her even more unstable. \\n\\n Do you not realize that the NHS piggybakcs on the Americans\\' system? They subsidize your healthcare. For example, drugs get invented there, the R&amp;D is paid for by the high drug prices Americans pay, and then you get those drugs for a cheap price.\\n\\nYou gotta look at the big picture, mate. How many hours of television a week does WWE broadcast? Like 11-12 a week? That\\'s going to turn away most people, even people who are more than just casual fans.  \"This [black woman - insert name] reminds me of Jackie Joyner Kersee!\" Every god damn time. 3 inches | 7.6 cm  \\n20 lb | 9.07 kg\\n\\n^metric ^units ^bot ^| ^[feedback](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=cannawen&amp;subject=metric%20units%20bot&amp;message=I%20think%20your%20bot%20is...%20%5BPlease%20include%20a%20link%20if%20you%20are%20reporting%20a%20bug%20about%20a%20specific%20comment!%5D) ^| ^[source](https://github.com/cannawen/metric_units_reddit_bot) ^| ^[block](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=metric_units&amp;subject=stop&amp;message=If%20you%20would%20like%20to%20stop%20seeing%20this%20bot%27s%20comments%2C%20please%20send%20this%20private%20message%20with%20the%20subject%20%27stop%27.%20If%20you%20are%20a%20moderator%2C%20please%20go%20to%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FSquaredCircle%2Fabout%2Fbanned%2F) ^| ^v0.7.9 *sigh* fine...fuck... I\\'LL do it. *Nevillution\\n\\nEdit: That awkward moment when you misread the room *slowly backs out of room* Yep, he thinks it\\'s, and I quote him, \"Lame Dad!\" As far as I am aware, his friends at school pretty much unanimously think the same from what he tells me. I mean, if your target audience can\\'t get engaged then something is seriously up. I\\'ve tried to get him into it but honestly, it couldn\\'t hold his attention and he is reaching for his Xbox joypad after 10 mins Lol. Oddly enough, he enjoys some of the older stuff like he thought Mankind vs Taker HIAC was pretty awesome when I had it on the network (I\\'m not joking for the purpose of this thread either). He makes me even more baffled with today\\'s product be honest as I am genuinely struggling to get my head around whether the other kids truly enjoy it. For example, at the moment he is mad for the Batman Arkham game series. They are gritty, edgy, let\\'s be honest, pretty damn cool, and most importantly of all, FUN. WWE at the minute really isn\\'t any of those things being brutally honest. \\n\\n She barely spoke! J.R. basically soloed 4 straight hours of commentary. He even tried so hard to lob softball prompts at her to get her going (you can tell because he specifically says her name each time), and she struck out on all of them. The NPC commentary in 2K17 sounds more natural &amp; engaged than Lita did in the MYC. The only time she remotely got involved in the talking was during Kairi/Tessa, the very last match. I can\\'t wait to see the Japanese crowd mark out for Tour of the Islands, especially when Cobb can hit it on anyone in NJPW. A person with a big personality is needed to balance out the blandness of Tom and Byron, and I don\\'t think Renee has that type of personality. DAE bought CM Punk\\'s house? Not only for Japan, it’s available in Portugal so I’d bet more places have it. They\\'ve been tagging in PWG since last December, and every match has been pretty great You\\'re full of shit. It\\'s literally *illegal* for your costs to be that high. The maximum out-of-pocket costs in 2016 is less than $7,000, and that\\'s even if you have the worst, most expensive disease on Earth. I\\'ll miss Booker T when this clown returns. I can\\'t remember exactly when, but, it was on /r/NSFW_GIF like, 2 months ago? Was the greatest fucking thing these eyes ever saw. It\\'s really an indictment on the WWE that \"book this guy to be champion because he\\'s over as hell\" is a revolutionary idea. No. /u/sullythered is just lying. It\\'s literally illegal for insurance companies to behave the way he claims. On the Reddit app. New to it and committed. Couldn\\'t figure out how to give you gold. Your comment, although I think it\\'s top shelf and was initially willing to gild but it wasn\\'t good enough for me to download Reddit is Fun just to pay $3.99 for imaginary gold. Have an upvote. Love you. &gt; Can\\'t afford healthcare\\n\\nHow is that possible? The US subsidizes healthcare for poor people. In fact, if you\\'re poor enough, it\\'s free. I asked myself this same question. I shouldn\\'t be so damn invested in these two hoping they get together but here we are. When I first heard about Ric\\'s health scares, a whole bunch of childhood memories came flooding back. \\n\\nI first started following wrestling when I was seven, and the big angle was Flair\\'s arrival in WWF with the WCW belt. Along with Bret Hart and Randy Savage, he quickly became one of my early favorites, and I played with my Flair action figure probably more than the other wrestlers I had. Immensely happy to hear he\\'s doing better.  (*History Maker intensifies*) Runs for booze for underage nephews and their friends for $10. Fact 1.

I never really noticed if she was good or not. All I noticed was the nonstop sexual tension with Regal. If you\\'re counting vignettes, Emmalina wasn\\'t a 1-night gimmick either. It\\'s not just one single thing. You need to have cardio inyour routine though. Well this just got entirely more interesting Let me guess, this is from China. Roman Reigns wins the match @ No Mercy Dave looking thick, solid, tight.  KO is a heel\\nNot the top baby face of the company  because......................reasons. Oh, yeah. That actually makes sense. Did they do the same for the CWC? Thats his \"What\\'s Kevin Nash up to these days\" look. Looks like I won\\'t do well in NjPW either :(. It\\'s being sold in the UK, where was it made? Nobody told me Dan Aykroyd was in this picture! Anyone know how tall he actually is?  It\\'s insane and they\\'re always up voted to like the second or third highest comment like the ignorant people who agree are positioning it like it\\'s a badge of honour to have guessed correctly when the odds are 50/50. It\\'s a shame how insecure people are over the preferences of others. Some things are opinion, some things a fact, some things are constructive and some things are taste. They aren\\'t all the same but half the people here seem to misunderstand the difference.  WTF? Who the hell would pay $30 a month for that? Enzo is terrible and Cass did absolutely carry the team. He shouldn\\'t be beating a guy like Neville who\\'s booked strongly and is actually good The gutbuster? Darren young and Roddy do ittoo, I like Bloody Sunday better But she\\'s BEEN daughter.. looks like he gained 10 years of age which probably makes up for looking 50 for 20 years Shinsuke with the the euro step. Balor and Bray will have a clean finish with regular balor pinning Bray clean to further bury his ass. Make who job to Roman Reigns?  Exactly zero people have a contract with PWG. YAPADOO!!! ... I hear voices in my head! If he checks his bags he shouldn\\'t.  HOLY SHIT! Somethings might be best kept to yourself Marty Tomorrow morning  The thing is, she chooses a career where \"stalking\" (read: hardcore fans) comes with the territory. You can\\'t have your cake and eat it to. She chooses the life of a celebrity wrestler. People want her autograph and are willing to go great lengths to get it. She should be honored, not offended. \\n\\nHer complaining is a big problem for only one reason: if she doesn\\'t like people asking for her autograph at the airport she can simply stop wrestling (read: being a celebrity). She has an out, just stop. However she wants to keep the celebrity \"but only at the arena\" (her words). \\n\\nThat\\'s not how it works. So if she wants the money and the fame, she has to put up with the fans. No matter where they are. That, or walk away (like Dave Chappell did when it got to be too much). Period. \\n\\n*EDIT: To all of those who are down voting me without saying anything. You stay quiet because you know I\\'m right. Watch this: ( https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/6xtpcg/miz_whether_its_an_adult_asking_for_my_autograph/?st=J75EKPN6&amp;sh=79b7841a ) now there is a guy who gets it.  This year\\'s Brooklyn crowd was full of shit. I don\\'t know what their problem was and sure they were great for the most part, but it was annoying. (Granted, I know people have different opinions when it comes to wrestling and that\\'s fine but that Brooklyn crowd was a little irritating.) The WWE has the Undertaker on their side, of fucking course they can resurrect motherfuckers. I\\'m sure the whole Ministry arrived in Reseda ASAP upon hearing of Cole\\'s death, chanted over his body and raised him from the dead.  If Jon Jones didn\\'t piss hot I\\'d probably say yes GTFO! Garlic bread chicken sandwiches are the www dot bomb dot com!!!!! Not that you mention it....WM17 is the \"real\" Rock vs Austin match....WM15, I forgot they even wrestled at this show... Well, I think he\\'s lying again. Because after he\\'s retire match, as always few months later he would coming back to the ring.  A cunt? Yeah. Eveything but the final is being uploaded tomorrow \"Bogus!\" Cool, thanks for the answer. My bad Do people still care about Enzo? Man, I was at work that night and had to hide to watch this match on my phone. It was hard containing my mark-out-moment when KO won CLEAN.  Isn\\'t he considered the worst IWGP Heavyweight Champion of all time? YOUR LYING! I DID NOT HIT YOU. YOU LIE.\\n\\nYOU\\'RE TEARING ME APART, KOTA. He claims it was for research. Something about paying for cp and then canceling the charge to show where the money goes or something like that. I don\\'t remember all the details. He was cleared of all charges but thst doesn\\'t mean anything.  Orton\\'s never really been the type to carry stiffs to good matches, has he? Completely agreed. Also I owned that Wolfpac tee thats mostly red with the wolf up front thats black. Really wish I could find one today in my size. but can you complain?  It\\'s better than the crap they are putting nowadays You\\'re pretending as if all the criticism is constructive, rather than the \"hurr durr you suck\" kind, which is likely what makes up most of it. I doubt Reigns is trying to ether people who are being reasonable.\\n\\nThere\\'s a truth to what he\\'s saying regardless of how much you dislike it. The negativity is coming from somewhere and it\\'s likely their circumstances.\\n\\n So you think being against fascists who are anti gay anti muslim anti women anti human rights and anti everything that isnt a straight white CIS male is trolling? How about you take your bigotry back to the bigot store. We dont need anymore of your crazy here Appears as if it was - don\\'t get why people like to shit on different wrestling companies. You don\\'t like it then fine let people watch what they want Why? I\\'d say it\\'s harder for everyone who downvoted my post. They can\\'t handle me naming bad storylines from the attitude era  Alternate American Version:\\n\\n\"Hey, hey pal, um you are in our seats\"\\n\\n\"Buddy, excuse me, yeah, you , you are in our seats\"\\n\\n\"What wait uhh, not understanding , (acts confused while pretending he can\\'t find his tickets)\\n\\n\"Dude get up these are our seats\"\\n\\n\"No I\\'m suppose to be here\"\\n\\n\"You re suppose to be here let\\'s see your ticket!!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have to show you shit, fuck off\"\\n\\n\"Fuck off, fuck you asshole, I\\'ll kick your fucking ass\" \\n\\nTwo scenarios - depending on venue security will rectify situation or both end up fighting and both get kicked out  It must REALLY suck to not have privacy - esp when you\\'re tired and cranky at an airport. Thinking of how to curb these eBayers -- what if you only signed things if you add his/her name on it? that way sales-wise it\\'s pretty useless but if you\\'re a fan, it has greater sentimental value.  Yeah, Young could easily keep using the Chickenwing and Roddy could keep using the End of Heartache and Sick Kick though, easily fixable. Jinder can wrestle better than most of the people from the attitude era, though, so I\\'d take him over them. Aries recently said he left on his own accord and it was because of nagging injuries and that he knows he\\'s getting up there in age so he wants to re-evaluate that and pursue other things non-wrestling related. So both of them are wrong.  Not just WWE mate. He beat R Truth in his next match that way WWE is better all the time. Ratings don\\'t matter for WWE anymore. NJPW isn\\'t as easy to watch as WWE is so that also means WWE is the best. WWE puts on the best product. He\\'s gonna rip the doors off like Robocop in WCW never heard about him being hard to work backstage. a lot of people actually said the opposite of that. WWE!!!!! I like NJPW BUT WWE will always be the best wrestling promotion of the year. If NJPW was more accessible then maybe it could be NJPW and NJPW just has matches with no story. I love the music you use for these edits, they fit so well!\\n\\nSong is Zero Gravity by Echoman  They probably booed because she didn\\'t acknowledge them and wanted a picture or an autograph or something. She went out to get a pizza! She\\'s not gonna talk to you while she\\'s eating! Self entitled pricks...  Subtle gay subplot Yes he did. He promoted everyone. Everyone who lost to him deserved to. Triple H is better than the people he beat. Wow, that looks freakin brutal. Good for Hana, sorry Hiromi.\\n\\nHana must have owed a favor to Mayu.  lol money well spent compared to the stories i\\'m reading in these comments  KAZE NI NARE! or Vince  PG doesn\\'t make it crap Pixar movies are PG and most of them are great. The problem is having tv comedy writers, vince micro managing everything, uninteresting characters imo Pentagon and Kenny have the best ring gear of basically anyone going today.  Different jurisdiction from the Fashion Files.  Whilst Steph gives you a blowjob and HHH oils your pecs.  When he somehow brainwashed sweet Maryse to marry him, dude is dead to me as far as I\\'m concerned.  Character depth. He\\'s CAW WWE talent, with a CAW moveset.  I live in Orlando too and actually ran into Sasha at Gods and Monsters last year, she was totally sweet especially since it was the day after her wedding(which I found out later) *This* argument again? Being in shape is one of the expectations you have for a wrestler (unless being out of shape is part of the wrestler\\'s gimmick, which does happen -- hey, it\\'s wrestling). Saying you can\\'t criticize a wrestler for not meeting that expectation is like saying you can\\'t criticize a player in the starting lineup of your favorite baseball team for hitting .220. You know what I\\'d hit if you handed me a major league contract? The answer is .000, but that doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t raise an eyebrow over a guy getting paid millions of dollars not performing to standards. I just want a 80\\'s TV Action show with comedic elements where Kenny Omega, Kota Ibushi, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn are like an A-Team and there is homoerotic tension throughout the series   I mean, maybe, but it\\'s hard to play a \"What if\" game of any kind with Japanese wrestling that excludes Jumbo. He\\'s one of the biggest stars ever and probably the best wrassler in the world for a loooooong time. Volador In the Ingobernables... Oh man. Oh man oh man oh man. Oh no? That\\'s such a flawed comment. You should talk to the about potential ways to expand your role. Let them know about you and what other potential you have. Nobody at all is saying that you approach a boss and say \"I am a dumb fuck help me\". Show initiative and a desire to learn.  I\\'m in your corner, I held a record for the fattest baby ever born for a while, I struggled with the weight and everything that comes with it all my life. It helps that I\\'ve got a business that makes me walk for hours, but if I got paid to work with my body and I new that if I got lean I would earn more. I would double my efforts.\\n\\nI\\'ve read many stories by bodybuilders of living unhealthy lifestyles and not eating healthy, yet they are able to lean out. All wwe champs have used or are using steroids and other drugs. Heck I\\'d join them or get my stomach cut in half, it\\'s going to pay itself in end run. Pretty spot on. Hey this is Simon from What Culture and here are the top 10 things that WWE does to anger its fans.  But did you go around trashing Okada, if not you’re not who this is directed to. My problem is when a controversial opinion suddenly becomes the opposite or “flipped”.  What the fuck man?! There is not one racist comment in this chain! You\\'re being delusional because you know you\\'re wrong! What\\'s really sad is the number of people that would definitely buy Elite/BC/Young Bucks-branded neck braces during that time lol That\\'s an attempted Shining Wizard, no? You mean broad, non specific rumours? In terms of overness now\\'s the best time for him.  I worry though that once he goes into a real feud with anyone that isn\\'t Brock or Roman it\\'ll be underwhelming and his flaws will be more glaring again.   I hate the R Trith character. It\\'s so Vince. Just a goofy corny Bushwackers type character. R Truth is a very good wrestler and they could make him a compelling character but they have gone Sesame Street with him.  hahaha i get it, it\\'s because they\\'re over 40...old fuckers With 2006 Triple H hair  People don’t seem to understand that wrestling isn’t about the quality of the match, it’s about making people care about watching the match. The belt means much more on somebody people give a shit about than it does on someone no one cares about who can wrestle a good match. \\n\\nNeville is awesome, and people do care about him, but Enzo is by far the only other person on that roster anyone gives a shit about. The entire point should be having him chase then win the title. If he doesn’t win it people will stop caring. And then you’re back to having a roster of people no one cares about.  I totally agree with you for the record, if I lived in the US and had the chance, I\\'d bring some self-made art and stuff to them just to lighten their mood because I have nothing but the utmost respect for these gyus and gals. They work their butt off every single week just to provide entertainment for me and I don\\'t have to pay a dime to see it? If anything, I should be thanking them for providing all that, for them going through those hardships, dealing with corporate crap on top of the physical stress, the travelling schedule, being public persons, having to deal with crazy fans, having to keep a strict diet, performing on live mics in front of thousands, knowing millions stand by via TV.\\n\\nSee, we can all shit on this or that wrestler we may not like (Brock Lesnar and CM Punk mostly for me) - but even these deserve credit for doing stuff I\\'d never in a million years would be willing to do and able to do and while some get paid very handsomely for it, the vast majority doesn\\'t and the vast majority also has severe health issues at some point.\\n\\nSo yeah, I totally get what you mean and while I would eventually check if someone is in a public place and willing to give me an autograph (but not if they\\'re spending time with their family or while travelling, I\\'m talking about spotting them in the mall or something) I\\'d not in a million years bother them in those other situations. That\\'s plain lack of respect and shitty behaviour.\\n\\nI am currently considering to, for the first time in my life actually, to reach out to some people who have brought me a ton of joy when growing up and also currently and say thanks to them with an actual letter, just reflecting on life and all, hoping it\\'d bring some joy back to them to know how much their work is appreciated.\\n\\n\\nCheers mate and rock on ;) &gt; It doesn\\'t matter if he\\'s good. That\\'s not his responsibility\\n\\nRespectfully disagree with him there. It\\'s not really fair to say it\\'s not any wrestlers responsibility to be good at wrestling. I get what he means in terms of Enzo not being known as a great performer, so it would be up to Neville to use his skill and carry the match more, but I wouldn\\'t just let Enzo off the hook so easily. I don\\'t think it was necessarily the time issues that caused it to be a problem, I think it was more the fact that they decided to carry on the 3spoopy5me nonsense and use a shitty projection of stock videos of disgusting stuff. It wasn\\'t wrestling ability, it wasn\\'t an exciting stipulation for the match, it wasn\\'t even Wyatt using it to his advantage.\\n\\nIt was just a video of maggots that Orton was laid upon. Thanks man and added The Phenomenal One. I don\\'t know how I missed that. Is it that surprising to think there are more masturbators than Latin scholars around here? He actually lost the rights because someone else got them first out of a box of cracker jacks. MFW you can\\'t see me coming out of nowhere  Is he even capable of lifting anyone up? Or Hogan If Tenryu didn\\'t leave Misawa wouldn\\'t have had the opportunities with Jumbo that he did. I still think he get\\'s over through sheer will power. Not a man alive has been able to touch a prime Misawa. She was better than a lot of people are making out. Especially when compared to the likes of Otunga and Watson - not a high benchmark I know.\\n\\nI thought she was witty and had some funny lines, it just didn\\'t always vibe with the action. But having her as colour commentator to Tom could work on SD I think - and it would be nice to a have a female voice especially on the women\\'s matches. Well, he IS old and ill... I\\'ve seen that screenshot time and time again but I didn\\'t see it in his facebook page so is this yet another hoax or did he really publish it? \\n\\n[I did find this though](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202590561139560&amp;set=a.3109649294512.142065.1062725443&amp;type=3&amp;theater) By that logic, anyone can learn to do anything and everything, and that\\'s just not true. Being a commentator for any sport is not easy, some people just aren\\'t the right type of personality for it, and having to deal with Vince in your ear isn\\'t for everyone either, even JR would tell you that.\\n\\nEDIT - I mean seriously people, that the ability to educate yourself exists does not mean you can become good at everything you try. you\\'re right tho it is the norm, america is the exception  Nice to see Aiden English picking up wins. One of the few guys on the roster who actually has a character and some form of charisma It depends on how Enzo wins it. If he comes in and just lands 100% of his offense and wrecks Neville, then yes, it looks bad for the division. But if Neville comes in completely arrogant, doesn\\'t take Enzo seriously and wrestles circles around him but misses on one move where Enzo can get a roll-up, or puts his feet on the ropes, or uses some other type of clever method to win then you have a naturally opposing contrast of styles and character. Then you have a story. I just hope Riddle doesn\\'t end up in a situation similar to Sydal.\\n\\nAside from that, this is some of the best news for NJPW. Both of those guys are A+ I went to a live event a while after the break up, and one of the two had a match. They had a sick theme that had the usual dubstep intro but then went into more classical sounding music. Never heard it again.  So I guess you don\\'t remember cena vs taker at vengeance 2003? I wanted him to be fired during the Mauro shit when it came out just how massive a fucking asshole he\\'d been for the past 20 years, because it would\\'ve sent a message that WWE was serious about supporting people with mental illness &amp; cracking down on bullying. But it never happened, because WWE is still ruled by a \"good ol\\' boys\" fuckin\\' carny mentality. So I stopped caring, because I don\\'t invest in unwinnable situations. Now, I\\'m just kind of pissed that they\\'re letting JBL retire on his own terms when he doesn\\'t deserve to. I\\'d still take Cena Styles over Braun Roman.....just felt much bigger Not overall recently but I think it\\'s the best feud either of them will ever have. I\\'m sure he is... :) I am a newer wrestling fan and don\\'t necessarily get all the intricacies yet (and I might not ever get there, tbh) but I think it\\'s great that she\\'s had a fast rise after moving on from NXT. It seems to be rare. I think it\\'s particularly awesome given how tiny she is and when you contrast what\\'s going on with Bliss with what is happening with Banks, Alexa is sort of a miracle.  He\\'s gotta do another run. Obviously not a wrestling run but a final send off. \\nAnd by final it will probably last about a month until he\\'s back but definitely a send off.  In this thread:\\n\\nPeople being downvoted for having their own opinions.\\n\\nIt\\'s ok for some people to prefer WWE over NJPW ffs. Feud has been great , easily best feud in 2017 but people are really overrating this feud \\n\\n\\n\\nThey didn\\'t have a classic match yet. All matches were either good or close to great\\n\\nFor example their ambulance match,  match quality wasn\\'t great but Segment after the match was classic\\n\\nI would say best feud in terms of sports entertainment. But in terms of matches , Roman had better matches with Lesnar, Styles,  Bryan \\n\\n\\nFeud was booked very well but didn\\'t had that big fight feel like Cena vs Styles or up coming  Cena vs Roman\\n\\nI would have said  feud as epic if they did a double turn after great balls of fire, but they went with predictable way next night. Well. Its safe to say 99% of the roster, including who they are building up as their top guys, do not have good booking. Excellent news! I\\'m really interested to see what Jeff Cobb can do on a stage like this - wrestling as \"himself\" (free of the monster-movie Lucha gimmick) and surrounded by some of the best talent in the world. I wasn\\'t very high on him in Lucha Underground initially, but the more they let him open up and wrestle long-form matches (instead of the all-out squashes they began with) I warmed up to the fact that he\\'s a unique talent with lots of potential.  Miz vs Bret. Get The New Day\\'s time machine and book it. 1999 is pretty notoriously terrible. The storylines are the height of Russo\\'s stupidity within the WWF and it\\'s one of the absolute weakest in-ring years ever for them too.\\n\\nHowever, this can be overlooked, because 2000 (to be more specific, the entire run from WrestleMania 2000 to WrestleMania 17) is THE greatest wrestling year of all time. People cared about him after Triple H. Booker being in the mid card made sense until being King Booker. He didn\\'t ruin Orton\\'s face turn he didn\\'t look like shit. Orton was never buried he didn\\'t ruin the voices in the head gimmick it still exists. RVD in the mid card made 100% sense. Being over doesn\\'t mean you have to be in the world title picture all the time. Umaga didn\\'t need the upper hand since he had a great career still he was a monster heel afterwards too. Jericho didn\\'t look like a pussy he walked into Mania as champion which is good enough. I\\'m not in denial. I\\'m just saying the truth. I know what I\\'m talking about. Triple H is a legend and one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. The one where the guy had a flab of his back hanging off was the one to thoroughly repulse me.  OH NO! Didn\\'t JR say on his podcast that they\\'d had to go back and re-commentate the matches? Maybe there was some sort of rough combining of the two commentaries and that\\'s why it feels forced? Honestly I was hoping no one would ask because it\\'s embarrassing.  I watched the Rowdy Roddy/Flair wife swap.  That was my source lol His star is fading real quick, because he was never supposed to be a singles guy. Neither was Cass. \\n\\nThey should\\'ve won the tag belts in NXT, then come up to Raw/SD and won them there, too. I\\'m talking big-time title matches with the Hardys, Revival, S&amp;C, etc. Instead they never got that tag title run they really deserved and I think it\\'s hurting them both as singles stars right now. \\n\\nIf they could never win gold as a team, how are we supposed to believe they can do it themselves? Enzo, especially. Hell I would argue 1996 is the true start of the Attitude Era. Goldust/Marlena, Pillman\\'s Gotta Gun, Sable, Austin 316 promo etc. that\\'s just off the top of my head I\\'m sure there\\'s stuff I don\\'t even remember. This is when it stopped being \"kiddy\" tv! Reigns has put up many 4 star matches. And Cena\\'s put 5 star matches up for years.  I don\\'t see it on his Facebook. But it\\'s looking like it was his long lost daughter on [this post](https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202590561139560&amp;set=a.3109649294512.142065.1062725443&amp;type=3&amp;theater) I would, but I can\\'t hear a word he\\'s saying! Holy shit, with those arms its only a matter of time before VKM gives him a call. \\n\\n\"GOD DAMNITT look at him! He\\'s so VASCULAR, I LOVE IT!\"  From what the Bucks have said, it sounds like they wouldn\\'t be heading back to NJPW for the foreseeable future. I do believe that they\\'ve stated that being away from their families for long stretches and the burnout of the travel are reasons why they appeared to wrap up their run there and will focus more on ROH until their contracts are up. Then they\\'ll be the hottest free agents on the market.  It\\'s really noticeable, and honestly lowers the overall aesthetic of the move. I think he took one ok pop-up from Owens early on, and the rest were garbage. The first promo he cut on Roode, had a bunch of references to iconic Hip Hop songs. His \"I feel like Elbow\" shirt is a bootleg Kanye West shirt. I assume his gimmick is he\\'s a Hip Hop Head. You are correct. I just assumed Mauro wouldn\\'t want to destroy a relationship with a company he has said is his dream job, and a boss that takes personal relationships very seriously. I mean who leaves a job on bad terms when you can leave it on good terms. I would think that is smart. Luke Balor I made an appointment but when I got there I couldn\\'t see him.  The end of the show. Roman coming out at 30 and Orton winning soured people on the show. B8 Reigns vs HHH, Reigns vs Taker, Reigns vs Cena etc. are better Reigns feuds along with Reigns vs Lesnar. One of the best ones yet. Can\\'t get enough of the man gravity forgot. His SummerSlam promo just wasn\\'t as good as his other promos. I lost interest pretty early on, and it seemed the crowd did as well.  Imagine actually believing this is plausible There was a long transition from New Generation to Attitude. If you watch the product in 1996, it is still very much marketed as the New Generation, and the shows still has plenty of New Generation characters, some of them got edgier sure, but it still is indeed a mid 90s product. The top guys are still Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels.\\n\\nI totally get why Attitude Era fans want to claim 97 or even 96 for that matter, but those years are not Attitude Era.  Hey Cody Collier how is life going I\\'m 30 and I still grow out a goatee like that every now and then Kenny is bisexual I don\\'t think Vince likes Australia Or you could just go to a fan event and talk to her like a normal person That\\'s how everyone in Japan acts all the time This is his best call for me, he gets me angry sometimes but he gets painted as a shitty announcer and he\\'s a damn good heel announcer in reality I love Neville especially where he is at the top of the cruiserweights but I always thought, back when he had nothing going on, that he and Apollo Crews would make a great tag team Technically Ambrose, too. So it seems that you haven\\'t seen the feud between DIY and The Revival. That\\'s the best feud WWE has had in the last two years. Oh the Eastern Sea\\'s so blue If Enzo goes over Neville clean I\\'m not watching 205 again.  War Machine are freelancers so can do whatever they want. Ospreay has a ROH/NJPW contract so can\\'t do Progress. It depends on what contract they sign. *He say, \"I know you, you know me\"\\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free...* Good bot Not that it makes a huge difference to your point but the Noam/Alicia angle has ended. Can\\'t tell if the show is much better or worse for it though. Yay ٩(&amp;#94;ᴗ&amp;#94;)۶ that\\'s awesome,i had no idea it\\'d be that soon,looking foward to watching them delete this nephew She always been hot That explains why my uncle randomly bends backwards every now and then  Cena / Ambrose / Styles, Miz / Ziggler, DIY (fuck you Ciampa) / Revival, to name a few better than Roman / Braun. It\\'s a fun feud though. It\\'s absurd to blame the person using their personal medication for Japan\\'s draconian and puritanical laws. The laws are the problem, not the choice to use cannabis.  Username checks out. anyone know how they justify this in kayfabe? Like I just got incapacitated by a finishing move which rendered me so useless that I couldn\\'t get a single shoulder up, however I can move my entire body and exit a ring an entire second later Don\\'t joke, I like Carmella more than Enzo and new Test. Vince McMahon was Sable?! To a limit. He hoisted Cesaro up for the reverse 1916 once but it wasn\\'t the prettiest. Anyone much bigger than Cesaro he probably couldn\\'t lift, which is why I think he should just stick to the Coup De Grace. I don\\'t go on twitter. I have a life. This version of wrestling fan makes me the saddest. I don\\'t give a single fuck about if Joe Schmo cheers.  Oh absolutely! Harper would THRIVE on the indies STRAYA He gave KO a Bloody Sunday in NXT. Haven\\'t seen him hit one on the main roster. Christ people are downvoting this? It\\'s a stupid move even if it went off as planned. I swear to god if he doesn\\'t say \"As I Was Saying...\" in a snarky as hell tone, I\\'m going to be so pissed at the missed opportunity. \\n\\nRaven: \"As I Was Saying...\"\\n\\nAnd this is why you\\'re one of my top 5s, Raven.  Jericho\\'s better. Better IC champ and better wrestler. I saw X-Pac walking around Hartsfield-Jackson airport late 2014 as I was on a business trip. He was decked out in a head bandana, leather jacket, and nWo t-shirt - I mention this because, in my mind, a wrestler wouldn\\'t dress like that if they didn\\'t want to be bothered at the airport. \\n\\nI still didn\\'t say a word to him. Didn\\'t whip out my camera to take a picture. I just watched him meander about the concourse as he went his way and I went mine. It feels more special that way because it only lives on in my memory and I didn\\'t annoy him.  Yes, it does. Good catch, thanks...updated. that is adorable  Damn!  and I was excited for Oka and Kitamura.  This should be amazing. I did not know this. \\n\\nPlease don\\'t let them go to WWE and become the ascension.  Love this saying.  Mike F\\'N Campana! That\\'s because goatees like that are awesome.  Doesn\\'t make sense. Mauro is a pure play by play guy. That\\'s Tom\\'s role in the SDL booth. Not sure either of them would be great in a color capacity [Here\\'s](http://imgur.com/gallery/f0Iu0xE) something for you. This is public knowledge? I\\'d think he\\'d keep that private JBL is a very good ring-side personality. He had a character and a personality. If you knew nothing about the back stage politics of wrestling, you\\'d still understand that JBL roots for the bad guy most of the time and has in-ring experience to call upon. Chris Jericho = Chris Jericho, is Chris Jericho. There are certain things they do in these series that make me laugh - the overacting of Cody and smacking the wall had me in stitches. \\n\\nI am calling it now - Flip Gordon is the WWE mole - he already has done business with The Revival.  [Rob Van Dam vs. Adrian Neville: WWE NXT, June 26, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdb66JZDqM) That\\'s some unbelievable signings. Both have specific qualities the Japanese audience will 100% love. Cobb\\'s power spots and Riddle\\'s legitimate shoot style are sure to get over big over there.\\n\\nI also feel like Riddle and Cobb could do the tag team / rival thing for the rest of their careers in various companies ala Zayn / Owens and really use that as a springboard for both of their careers. That\\'s Brock Lesnar Guy?\\n\\nI always thought that was the dude in the lime green shirt, front row center for the big PPVs. Chris Jericho is Bowie. Old veteran of the scene who never relied on sticking to his classic material for an easy payday but kept reinventing himself to stay relevant to the current day. Buddy Nick has that sweet MacBook to edit on now How about; \"If there is one person that can match AJ Styles in skill, it\\'s Jimmy Uso\" -to coin\\n\\n+who was fed the line He epitomises somebody \\'playing\\' wrestler. There\\'s nothing authentic about him. There\\'s nothing original about him. He sucks at promos. He\\'s not believable. He can\\'t sell a match. He\\'s mediocre in every way possible. \\n\\nYeah. He\\'s missing a bunch if you ask me.  Not quite, the streamer incident happened after that. But it would\\'ve been a nice continuation of the Mayu-Oedo Tai story. [Luke Harper and Erick Rowan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNYgKarvftU) both deserved better. The Wyatt Family should have become a HUGE force in the WWE, winning championships along the way. That turd Rovert is all \"yeah well I totally knew this for weeks\" about this. I thought this was going to be something else initially.\\n\\nThey did an angle where a \\'fan\\' would jump the barricade and attack Raven. However, this fan was actually Chris Kanyon. \\n\\nI have a vague memory of there being copycat real fans attacking Raven as a result. And you making the claim that what he\\'s done with his life is any greater than what I\\'ve done with mine when you don\\'t know what I\\'ve done and whom it is that I\\'ve done for is just as libelous as anything I\\'ve said against Layfield. That\\'s okay though. I wouldn\\'t \"spect\" someone who is so quick to come to the rescue of someone with the character of John Layfield to understand much of anything.  \\n\\nNice try though.  Long shot in the grand scheme of things but JR\\'s still under contract for a while right? I mean he said some racist shit and in this day and age you just don\\'t get a pass for that, and I definitely don\\'t dismiss it but me being a minority... idrgaf that\\'s my guy Hulk, he served his time... we need mania to run wild most of what I read suggests RoH is the company with hang ups. With whom do you have in mind? After the filming of this promo, Flair tore the shirt off, threw it onto the floor, and gave it a jumping rolling knee. I think Steve Austin mentioned it once on his podcast. Dolph needs to be more \"selfish\" in the ring. Dude\\'s so giving in making others look good, he forgets to make himself look badass in the process. Like, when\\'s the last time you remember him kicking someone\\'s ass? He\\'s not a big fan, he\\'s Cody Collier under another name because he\\'s been banned three or four times. It\\'s a troll he\\'s that young knock out kid Wroooooooong. Randy orton = j cole. All the talent and skills in the world. Both were amazing in the beginning but since have been on cruise control.  Brilliant story telling by Nick Jackson. After they finisher wrestling I hope the bucks become bookers  I\\'m clearly out of the loop. What did Aries do? Hey man! I ended up sitting in the first seat by the rail and had a great time! A whole bunch of kids stood behind me during entrances which was a mix of annoying and fun. Fun when Curtis axel yelled at them haha, Enzo (who is terrifying in person, he does look like a weponized meth head) got really hype with them. \\n\\nI ended up getting a lot of high fives/agknowlegment! Jeff hardy was really sweet and gave everyone high fives down the row. I was wearing my cesaro shirt so uhh I didn\\'t think I was allowed to? But he stopped said \\'it\\'s ok\\' and high fived me. \\n\\nIt was very long though, and couldn\\'t hold my attention unlike Raw could. (same length) ended up leaving during Cena/Wyatt which was right next to our seats so we could get out of there. Man the other people must have thought we were crazy. \\n I was thinking the same. He\\'s tall like Cody, great size and only 26.  Sexual Chocolate was stupid as hell. \\n\\n1999 didn\\'t pick up until Triple H became a major player. It was otherwise garbage. MIKE JOOOOONES I don\\'t think most of the people in the business have a problem with fan interactions as long as they\\'re civilized. There are, however, quite a few overenthusiastic weirdos that will, for example, come tearing after you down a freeway to call you a monster for not waving at them when they yelled out your name, a la Paige. I don\\'t recall exactly what happened but I know she was sharing something along those lines on twitter at some point last year. Some woman and her husband (possibly with kids, too) wanted some of her time and when they didn\\'t get the acknowledgment they felt they deserved they chased her down the road yelling at her or something similar. Pretty frightening.  Just watch the segment when AJ and John were in same ring together for first time..You will know what big matches feel like if only she was related to The Rock I always want to refute this when people say it because I don\\'t want it to be true :( he\\'s been my favorite scince I started watching.  I was live for that show and hates the finish. That was some WWE SDL Road Dogg booking.  That his gimmick  A shitty way to start a great feud He was pac from the jungle! It normally happens around Survivor Series. Current plans are to have the finals at the Takeover Huston they do before Survivor Series this year, like they did last year at Takeover Toronto. She was God awful in NXT. JbL is like ventura x heenan compared to her. Neville went from being a literal Superhero character to being the best heel on perhaps the entire roster. He totally transformed himself for this gimmick and his matches with everyone have been great. Dude is absolutely top 5 in the company, and I\\'d love to see him step away from the Cruiserweights and challenge Brock/Roman for the Universal belt.  I’m currently in the year 2000 Haha I need to party with Marty befofe it\\'s all said and done. He\\'s fuckin\\' comedy. I.... wouldn\\'t mind this \"THESE GUYS ARE JUST FUN TO WATCH!\"\\n\"WE GOT OURSELVES A COUPLE OF FLYING USOS!\"\\n\"AND ITS NOT THE SWING THAT BOTHERS YOU ITS THE SUDDEN STOP!\" \\n\"I LOVE IT MAGGLE!\"\\n\"BALLGAME!\" I doubt Cornette cares about their sexuality. He pretty liberal.  IT TALKS That is crazy. Hopefully he can stay healthy.  It\\'s been fun, but Cena/Styles, Ambrose/Styles, and Ziggler/Miz are just a few from recently that are better  Yeah... like... to each their own I guess. But... \"Oh, wow\" at every other move is not something I would consider good commentary. YOKO? You absolutely do. Just lifting weights won\\'t see results nearly as fast as a proper diet together with cardio. Particularly HIIT style cardio.  Precisely. The whole \"Wyatt never wins\" thing is so overblown.  I think it\\'s debatable whether Roman is a full blown baby face. I can\\'t recall the last time he pandered to any crowd. Me too. I will definitely be ordering this DVD.  So jealous of the people in attendance.  a.k.a Baby\\'s First Snuff Film Yes - filmed it last night according to the latest WOR. The lazy eye though.  feels more sleazy to me, both work I assume Roman Cena is gonna be fantastic 4-4.5* and Stroman Lesnar depends on what Lesnar wants to do. If he wants to do more the just suplex it should be good  &gt;@KennyOmegamanX vs @PENTAELZEROM\\n\\nMega Man vs Zero\\n\\nOH SHIIIIT!!!! How recent? He\\'s the No.1 mic worker, though, and is probably among the best character workers. Quite frankly he\\'s untouchable in the promo category, and even though his matches aren\\'t always that exciting anymore he\\'s still hella entertaining. \\n\\nI\\'ll get shit, but I\\'d watch Deano in a World Title feud over Cesaro or Seth any day. He can get anything and anyone in any situation over and make something good with whatever hand he\\'s dealt.  Nevillution  I didn\\'t mind her at the role. Definitely kicked Lita\\'s ass. You honestly haven\\'t a clue if you think this isn\\'t normal for rich people. An absolute lad FUCK YESSSSSS I wish they\\'d diversify the creative ideas and lay off the foreign anti-America heel gimmicks for a while. Exactly. And Heath Slater has pinned Seth Rollins, for example. The most compelling wrestling comes from when you can believe both sides can win. What happens if the show is in Canada? Does tossing Alexa get you DQ? He was probably bummed no one came up to him.  I\\'m hoping to wake up and see Daniel Bryan has been released and that he and CM Punk are a tag team in the G1. Our mutual dislike of HHH\\'s bullshit makes CM Punk ok in my book  He was Toryumon bred. The Mexican promotion run by Ultimo Dragon, who trained him.  Russo really needs credit for this. He did a great job putting a show together from start to finish. Whatcha think about that, Bird? This is EXACTLY what the Tag League needs. Use it to bring in freelance/new guys and let them wow people. And hopefully take the workload off the top stars before WK. Wait. Wasn\\'t Thunder pre-taped back then? Why they  didn\\'t edit this out? Oh wow I just saw this in 2017! No, you don\\'t. The key to fat loss is diet, not cardio.  I don\\'t think he ever said it \"properly\", but he hinted at it multiple times. Does LU have the same waiting period RoH does? If I have one major problem with wrestling it\\'s that sect of fans that think they know everything and know who deserves to be pushed, etc... your not wrong about Roman by no means I\\'m not a huge fan of the guy myself  The thing with Enzo is that his ring work means fuck all. People care about the character. He\\'s got more personality than the entire division.  Thank you for the mnemonic.  That\\'s now two I\\'ve gotten from /SC, the first using Fallon and Leno to explain which Uso brother is which. \\n\\n His own style. He\\'s way to much like Shawn Michaels Ah, didn\\'t know that.  I had forgotten about Mayu-Oeda Tai story line, it really would have been a neat little piece to add to that story. I believe it\\'s 90 days after the season ends TitusFace.Jpeg Fellow Australian here, post-school, I think I\\'ve met 3 wrestling fans (that I know of), in about 10 years, and I\\'ve not wanted to associate with any of them. I never bring up the fact I\\'m basically a lifelong wrestling fan, as it\\'s always been an express trip to the worst part of someone\\'s personality, or the catalyst for ridicule. I\\'m fine with the ridicule, but I don\\'t want to find out that the seemingly interesting and intelligent person I\\'ve just met fantasy books on r/sc in their free time. [Stupid Sexy Ibushi.](http://i.imgur.com/gY7sy9E.png) Wasn\\'t this a botchamania series lol?\\n\\nEdit: found them, they were called \"only fools rush in.\"\\n\\nPart 1 - http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2rtuhe\\n\\nPart 2 - http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2rzsx1 2000 is a wonderful year overall. Virtually every PPV delivered (save for Mania 16) and the main roster scene was fresh, new faces rose into the scene and put on great matches, TV was really fun to watch too with a lot of great undercard matches and angles that weren\\'t simply forgotten about in weeks later.\\n\\n1999 was the end result of giving Russo far too much power and him essentially running aground with overbooked matches, frequent title changes (you think the raw women\\'s title was bad, wait til you see the WWF title in early 1999), and angles that just go off the rails. Was it fun? Yeah. But it\\'s like looking at a movie you watched over and over again as a kid but eventually saw all the flaws in it as a grown person and you can\\'t help but cringe at parts. GFW internationally is about on par with WWE as that seemed to be where Dixie\\'s priorities lay, which given Jarrett plans, seems to be the perfect foundation for GFW to grow off of. TNA\\'s international deals are why every last man and woman on the face of the planet with cash to spare and a desire to enter the wrestling business wanted to buy TNA so bad. Despite all that, GFW are failing big time in America. \\n\\nIn America, they\\'re doing better than Lucha Underground but as far as other televised wrestling goes, they\\'re not that hot. They\\'re on par with ROH for ratings, yet are lagging behind ROH in every other aspect, including live events, merch, and PPV revenue. As for the Indies, most top tier indie companies sell out major shows and sell merch just fine making them more successful than GFW in that aspect, but they\\'re not successful enough to grow any further. \\n\\nExpect PWG, Evolve, Progress, or ICW (whatever happened to them?) to be the next Indie Company to break out of the cycle and be the next ROH. There will never be enough perfect circumstances to warrant another TNA again, not unless WWE somehow disolves and Shane goes off to found his own wrestling company.        TM-61 should be back by then.\\n\\nThey made the final last time, and it could be a good redemption story if they win it this time. Would love to see them vs reDRagon in the final. ambrose vs miz on smack down was pretty good. I would want to see Ricochet in NXT but not 205. I just don\\'t want his talent to be in the hands of WWE creative. 6 stars in the toyko dome I don\\'t see where I have said diet isn\\'t important. Look at my other posts in this thread and you\\'ll see posts about diet being crucial. The point you are ignoring is the resistance/cardio issue. Any good balanced exercise plan includes cardio. It absolutely increases fat loss. Don\\'t be a twat. What is her role now?  It won\\'t be my first time in First.  It was fantastic.  But the difference in price on this trip between first and super-coach was low enough for me to splurge a little. \\n\\nI was actually considering before this stuff was available to wear a Monster Among Men t-shirt in first with black jeans.  \\n I feel like there should be someone with a SJW gimmick. Like the modern day right to sensor I am probably going to be alone in this but since Kairi Sane/Hojo went to WWE, Stardom have seriously pulled their finger out and are putting out really good solid stuff. A wrong improper lad He won\\'t do anything more than what he\\'s done because of his clear intentions of signing to wwe. New Japan will be fine without him, they have three of the best juniors in the world and some other great talents like Bushi, Taguchi and El Desperado, i honestly can\\'t see Ricochet as junior champion any time soon. Watch his Atlas Title matches in Progress.  That would be a good start. Anything you want me to put into a time capsule? They could move Graves to SDL then bring back Lawler as heel Lawler for Raw.  Not true at all. Everyone who faces Triple H reaches their true heights.  Triple H wins and loses when he should so he doesn\\'t really have any wrongs. He didn\\'t stall or ruin the careers of people just by beating them. He puts everyone over just by feuding with them. Not true at all. Cole is amazing even when he\\'s micro managed. Heavy scripted promos are good. WWE from 2008 to current is the best it\\'s ever been. You expect too much. If you don\\'t have a script then something bad will happen. It\\'s a shame how so many injuries have been plaguing WWE\\'s tag divisions. TM61 were really starting to connect with the crowd finally, and then they\\'re out for months.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s all the bad luck for The Revival, Ciampa\\'s injury and New Day have had a couple of minor injuries. One of the Shining Stars got injured, I remember. Might be forgetting someone. Really hasn\\'t helped the tag divisions. I can get when it\\'s a really big guy that can\\'t work but is a spectacle. Make them look good brings money. So a guy like Strowman or whatever, yeah make him look good.\\n\\nBut Enzo isn\\'t Strowman. He\\'s not some big dude that people look at and buy into.\\n\\nHe\\'s a scrawny, annoying twerp. And this isn\\'t the Heavyweights where big, buff men get Vince all hot and bothered so everyone has to make them look good.\\n\\nThis is cruiserweights, marketed to workrate fans.\\n\\nIf Enzo can\\'t work, nothing will hide that. It will annoy those fans even more, and at that point you might as well just scrap the division, because you just alienated the very fanbase you were looking to entice.\\n\\nCasuals will flock to the big guys with the \"look\" at the top. But they won\\'t buy little guys that can\\'t even wrestle.\\n\\nEnzo should get squashed and be a jobber until he can build up. \\n\\nI would buy Ellsworth over Enzo.  Sounds perfect for Dragon Gate. Mark my words!  Blake will soon be universal champion and the greatest cowardly heel in wwe.  He will start a dx like stable full of outcasts who will torment the young talent of wwe.  He will also be solely responsible for the overdose death of Jeff hardy and the bankruptcy of John cena. NBA loving Kung Fu Panda. ...you mean I don\\'t? He\\'s got great charisma in the ring, just not on the mic. Hopefully he puts in the hours to get better otherwise he\\'s 100% doomed to the \"Smiley flippy guy\" role, which really doesn\\'t get you over long term in WWE. I always enjoyed Jeff\\'s singles runs, but they always seem to end badly. I really hope something big comes from this and it\\'s not just a repeat of the times he\\'s won the IC/World/WWE Titles. I\\'m worried that their run is heading in the same direction that the Dudley\\'s went after their return. I loved that they had him wrestle during the UK tournament so he could have sort of a hero\\'s welcome. Triple H gets it. &lt;3 It frustrates me so much that the cruiserweights are being segregated and can\\'t fight anyone from the main roster. Don\\'t the top brass realise how ridiculous it makes them look? That the pinnacle they can reach is only the cruiserweight title. I really want to see Neville vs Balor, or even vs Joe. Really hope they unite the rosters sooner rather than later. nae pinkie, nae party\\ncatchye That is the most retarded thing Jericho may have ever said.  It is just as much Enzo\\'s job to make Neville look good as it is Neville\\'s to make Enzo look good. The difference is that you don\\'t have to suspend disbelief that much to think a wrestler who has been training for years can wrestle. Arquette came off the street as the goofy actor who only played losers. He had no credibility whatsoever.  JBL was not good either. I actually enjoyed Renee in NXT. Might as well give her a shot at commentary on Smackdown rather than wasting her as a backstage interviewer. You started watching at?  That is too much of an ass kissing. Being in a feud with someone doesn\\'t automatically raise your stock and if it\\'s any indication everyone I mentioned had their stock diminished for a period of time before recoveringa and some of them have never recovered. The in ring storytelling of this feud was amazing. \\n\\nDuring the first match cena does his same old crap but then loses\\nThen during the second match cena does like 4/5 moves he\\'s never done before (because his same old doesn\\'t work) and wins \\nThen both crank out like a billion new moves for the final. Owens even kicking out of 3 AA\\'s. (And one was from the top :0 )\\nOwens tapping was also great because cena couldn\\'t pin him. \\n [Yeah... about that.](https://youtu.be/zc-kMt1Cn4Y?t=1m13s) Online, but you\\'ve got about a 45 second window to grab them When I think of great recent feuds my mind goes to Owens vs Jericho because it had such a great long-term story, compare that to Reigns and Strowmen who were seemingly thrown together randomly before their feud was paused so Reigns could retire undertaker before starting up again. When I think of great feuds I think of the story that leads to the matches and while Reigns and Strowmen had some good no dq type matches their story hasn\\'t been anything special imo. I think it\\'s more of a NJPW type of thing. Dominate the Cruiserweights and move back up to heavyweight. It\\'s rejuvenated his career and his style would make him stand out more if he was seen as more legit. Judging from their website (which you could have just looked up yourself) they only show 2 wrestling things. A comedy company called Osaka funny wrestling (which the thumbnail has Kilutaro and someone else I can\\'t quite recognize) and the all female company from Japan called Oz Academy. I would guess they\\'re pretaped.  Yeah, if anything he should beat Tozawa for the title a on a technicality, only to find himself suddenly being pursued by Tozawa and Neville both, getting squashed by Neville, and ultimately having to work together with Tozawa to dethrone him (thus transitioning to a more manager-type roll and possibly a program with Titus or Apollo Crews) Neither did Graves or Tom at NXT. Vince has no idea how to make people look good in defeat. I\\'m in the middle of watching 98 Raws from the AE. It\\'s SO bad  That\\'s fine, but the entire point of wrestling is to trick people in to paying for fake fights because of the personalities and the story.   You can only buy them online through PWG\\'s website. They sell out within minutes.  Agree to disagree Lmao. I can\\'t believe that\\'s serious. He should search pubmed a bit to get up to speed on sex differences.  embarrassing. You might be like me as I can only watch so many brawls and street fights before I get bored and want to watch a proper wrestling match. RevPro British J-Cup, it did happen. Yes it does and their stock didn\\'t diminish and if it did it\\'s their fault that they couldn\\'t have as great of a feud and match as they did with Triple H. No one needed to recover everyone was just fine after facing Triple H. It\\'s all about the game and how you play it. Lawler immediately reprimanding JR for the glass is hilarious Ha, five minutes. If only it was that long. No. Lesnar/Strowman should probably have a non-clean finish to protect Strowman, because I doubt they\\'re swapping the belt. So be prepared for that, and try to enjoy the match for what it is.\\n\\nRoman/Cena, I\\'m not sure what to expect. Cena probably wants Reigns to step up and prove himself. The last time someone did that it was Triple H/Reigns and it didn\\'t go very well. With the somewhat limited capabilities of Cena at this stage of his career, Triple H is a pretty good comparison. He can go out and have a good match, but for a great match his opponent is going to have to carry their own weight.\\n \\nBut Reigns is a better performer now than he was then. He\\'s not a great improviser, but he can do a pattern match very well. &gt; these amazing pre-made characters\\n\\nThat\\'s the problem, imo.  They tell a whole story, and bring the finished character to Main; where at least half the audience doesn\\'t know them, but they also can\\'t re-create the story, because that would bore the other half. With nowhere to go, non-NXT watchers have nothing to get behind and NXT watchers start finding them boring. Spectacular entrances cover that up some, but they can only do so much. Add the bad handling of faces, and you have the current situation.\\n\\nIn that sense, old NXT, maybe even FCW was better all in all, they could do a complete do-over and a fresh debut. Asshole Scot association football player. Maybe think about what you\\'re saying before you post. Exactly. Book the story as Enzo going out of his way to prove something to himself and those who dismiss him. Cass dropped him because he considered dead weight and a liability, but if he wins the CW title then that\\'s his way of sticking it to him.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s laughing now? I\\'ve got a championship, but all you\\'ve got is a bad knee!\" I read it occasionally. I\\'m not sure this place is much better. There\\'s just large enough number of users combined with a downvote button to minimize the toxicity.\\n\\nThe obsessive Bliss hatred is present here as well. I know this because those people typically post about her far more than I do and I\\'m a fan. Ultimately they can do what they want. I enjoy her. If others don\\'t then so be it. I do find it a bit ironic though that people who frequently throw shade about obsessed Bliss fanboys can\\'t go a thread without posting about her. But that is their right I suppose.\\n\\nPeople become extremely toxic in particular when it comes to women\\'s wrestling which leads to the extremely irrational and over the top criticisms of anyone who isn\\'t their personal favorite or the inability to deal with their favorite losing a match. There are lot of women wrestlers I like in spite of their obnoxious or overzealous fan bases. I respect those that have favorites but can still rationally discuss the product. But they\\'re few and far between on every discussion board. [Well shit me up a rope](https://hamm0ndeggs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/simpsonsdidit.png) This. 100% I mean, realistically, you\\'ll be looking at least a week behind, but man, being able to stay up to date with international wrestling would be awesome.  SAVE_US.JBL Flipping fantastic news. Can\\'t wait to see em. Riddle won\\'t quit, he talked about wanting to do a deal with WWE where he pays for his monthly weed fines upfront for the year.  I feel like we had a universe split where a child was picked on and in one universe the parents got the kid a home gym and he trained and became Neville and in the other the parents didn\\'t and the kid resorted to humor to defend himself and Weird Al Yankovik was created and somehow both ended up in this universe. \"Enzo is a bad worker\" does not marry up with the amount of good matches he had in NXT. Don\\'t try and tell me it was all big cass because he really isn\\'t a good worker. \\n\\nEnzo is perfectly capable but that\\'s it, put him in with someone who knows what he\\'s doing (Revival) to help make the match look good and enzo will sell it. \\n\\n Cuck YES! Search him on YT, I think floslam put up some stuff Vince saw how bad booking got Daniel Bryan so over As much as id want to believe this,Vince still owns both shows. Itd make no sense to sacrifice one show to better the other in that way. I think the shift happened when people like Ambrose and Miz and Wyatt joined team red. Smackdown live had the feel of upper mid carders smarks wanted to finally see get pushed, now it seems like a dumping ground for those not picked to represent the flag ship show. SDL got screwed in the shake up. Feuds were ended prematurely. Take Wyatt v Orton for the tittle. House of Horrors was intended to be a wwe title rematch. Then it just became a really weird and pointless gimmick match that did nothing for anyone involved. I think the balance of superstar power is the issue more than the writing It\\'s the booking. Whenever given something good to work with, he nails it. Problem is, 1) That hasn\\'t happened since No Mercy last year. And really, Survivor Series \\'14 before that, and in that, he was just a fill-in guy for Roman allegedly. And 2) At the culmination of any feud, the next RAW/SD they act like it never happened and never continue with the momentum. They pull the rug out from underneath him and send him back to glorified jobbing. No kidding people are gonna stop getting behind him and see him as one-dimensional...  \\n\\n  \\nHe never got a proper world title run due to the concussion, but at least we got the MITB cash-in (reportedly) thanks to Pat Patterson.  \\n  \\nAlso, he\\'s not the new Shawn Michaels just because he has a good look and tuned up the band a couple times... This is one of the narratives that really needs to go away. I will say it didn\\'t make sense for him to do this as a face, but obviously perfect sense as a heel to draw heat.  \\n  \\nHonestly, I\\'d say if his voice was a little coarser, deeper and he was a few inches taller, he\\'d be Vince\\'s wet dream. Can\\'t wait for the one where Haitch suplexes a fan and starts whaling on em Did you buy it? But they already have a heavyweight tag team. Or say that Jon Moxley needs to start doing death matches again. Uk he gets a lot of hate but he is responsible for 95% of this subs love for the sport  So him having a world title shot, being sent to the midcard after being dispatched easily (despite being over with everyone) and then recieving another shot 4 years later only due to unrelenting fan support, doesn\\'t count as burying? Same goes with Booker T, him getting racially insulted and then being embarassed at wrestlemania by staying down for almost 10 seconds after a pedigree, going down into the midcard to have a few us title feuds and then only regaining strong fan support (at Smackdown, away from Triple H)after completely reinventing himself, doesn\\'t count as burying? These wrestlers had every requirement to go to the top (including favour from the fans) yet had to wait years and take extra steps just to reach that level again only because of Triple H\\'s massive ego and jealousy towards Rock and Austin, is that fair? Your argument boils down to \\'wins and losses don\\'t matter\\' which is absolute bullshit and your claims that people stock didnt diminish is equally bullshit and pure denial. (Umaga left shortly after, so did steiner, so did goldberg) I\\'m not going to spend my time arguing with you because you clearly just love triple h too much, think what you want.
